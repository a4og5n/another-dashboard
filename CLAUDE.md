# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Git Branching Strategy

**üõë BEFORE EDITING ANY FILE - CHECK YOUR BRANCH FIRST:**

```bash
git branch --show-current  # MUST run this BEFORE making ANY changes
```

**If output is "main" ‚Üí STOP and create feature branch NOW**

---

**NEVER WORK DIRECTLY ON MAIN BRANCH**

This project uses a **feature branch workflow**. All development MUST happen on feature branches, never directly on `main`.

### Correct Workflow:

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/endpoint-name

# 2. Make commits on feature branch
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: ..."

# 3. Push feature branch
git push origin feature/endpoint-name

# 4. Create PR
gh pr create --base main --head feature/endpoint-name

# 5. Merge PR after approval and CI passes
```

### Why This Matters:

- ‚ùå **Direct main commits bypass code review** - No PR discussion, no approval process
- ‚ùå **No opportunity to catch issues** - Changes go live without review
- ‚ùå **Breaks team collaboration** - Others can't review or suggest improvements
- ‚úÖ **Feature branches enable proper review** - PRs allow discussion before merge
- ‚úÖ **CI runs on PRs** - Checks pass before merge, not after
- ‚úÖ **Safe experimentation** - Branch can be deleted if approach doesn't work

### No Exceptions: All Changes Go Through PRs

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Git hooks enforce branch-first workflow for ALL changes (including documentation).**

**Correct workflow for ANY change:**

1. Create GitHub issue (if not exists)
2. Create feature branch: `docs/description-issue-123` or `feature/description-issue-123`
3. Make changes and commit on branch
4. Push and create PR
5. Merge after CI/CD passes

**Why no exceptions:**

- ‚úÖ **Consistent workflow:** Same process for all changes (simpler mental model)
- ‚úÖ **Git hook enforcement:** Pre-commit hook blocks commits to main
- ‚úÖ **AI workflow alignment:** AI always creates branches first, never assumes exceptions
- ‚úÖ **Audit trail:** All changes trackable via PRs and issues
- ‚úÖ **CI/CD validation:** Even docs go through linting and formatting checks

**Previous exception removed (2025-10-27):**

- Old rule: "Documentation can be committed directly to main"
- Problem: AI relied on git hooks to catch mistakes instead of being proactive
- New rule: AI creates branches FIRST, for all changes (code or docs)
- Result: No failed attempts, cleaner workflow, better audit trail

### Historical Context:

**2025-10-23**: Domain Performance endpoint was mistakenly pushed directly to main (commits c87c5f6 through cf324b4). While CI passed retroactively, this bypassed the PR review process.

**2025-10-25**: Issue #239 cleanup was mistakenly committed directly to main (commit 440ee8a). The commit was reverted (ce4d609) and resubmitted via PR #243 for proper CI/CD validation.

**Lesson:** Even low-risk technical debt cleanup MUST go through the PR process.

**2025-10-27**: Updated workflow to remove documentation exception. AI now creates branches FIRST for all changes (code or docs), preventing reliance on git hooks to catch mistakes.

### AI Implementation Guidelines

**Before making ANY changes (code or documentation):**

1. ‚úÖ **Check current branch:** `git branch --show-current`
2. ‚úÖ **If on main:** Create issue + feature branch IMMEDIATELY
3. ‚úÖ **Never assume exceptions:** All changes go through PR workflow
4. ‚úÖ **Be proactive:** Don't wait for git hooks to block commits

**Decision Tree:**

```
User requests change
    ‚Üì
Is there an issue for this work?
    ‚îú‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Create issue first (gh issue create)
    ‚îî‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Continue
         ‚Üì
Are we on main branch?
    ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Create feature branch NOW (git checkout -b docs/... or feature/...)
    ‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Continue on existing feature branch
         ‚Üì
Make changes ‚Üí Commit ‚Üí Push ‚Üí Create PR ‚Üí Merge
```

See "Phase 0: Git Setup" in the AI-First Development Workflow section below for complete implementation details.

## Commands {#commands}

**Development:** `pnpm dev` (HTTPS + Turbopack) | `pnpm build` | `pnpm start` | `pnpm clean`

**Quality:** `pnpm lint` | `pnpm lint:fix` | `pnpm type-check` | `pnpm format` | `pnpm format:check`

**Testing:** `pnpm test` | `pnpm test:watch` | `pnpm test:ui` | `pnpm test:coverage` | `pnpm test:a11y`

**Workflows:** `pnpm quick-check` (type + lint) | `pnpm pre-commit` (full validation) | `pnpm validate` (includes build)

**Standard Validation Suite** (run before committing):

1. `pnpm type-check` - Must pass with zero errors
2. `pnpm lint:fix` - Auto-fix linting issues
3. `pnpm format` - Format all files
4. `pnpm test` - All tests must pass

**Database:** `pnpm db:push` | `pnpm db:generate` | `pnpm db:migrate` | `pnpm db:studio`

**Docs:** `pnpm docs` | `pnpm docs:watch`

**Page Generator:** `pnpm generate:page` (interactive CLI for humans)

## Architecture

**Stack:** Next.js 15 (App Router) + TypeScript (strict) + Tailwind v4 + Vitest + Zod + Drizzle ORM + Neon Postgres

**Auth:** Kinde (user auth) + Mailchimp OAuth 2.0 (API access, tokens encrypted AES-256-GCM)

**Project Status:** MVP complete, OAuth 2.0 migration done, post-MVP feature development

**Node/pnpm:** v24.7.0 / v10.15.0 (via Homebrew: `brew install pnpm`)

### Project Structure

- `src/app/` - Next.js pages, layouts, API routes
- `src/components/` - UI components (ui/, dashboard/, layout/, accessibility/, performance/, pwa/, social/)
- `src/actions/` - Server actions with test coverage
- `src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions (mailchimp/, components/)
- `src/schemas/` - Zod validation schemas (mailchimp/)
- `src/utils/` - Pure utility functions
- `src/lib/` - Config, encryption, Mailchimp client, error classes
- `src/services/` - API service classes (singleton pattern)
- `src/hooks/` - React hooks
- `src/db/` - Database schema, migrations, repositories
- `src/test/` - Test setup, utilities, architectural enforcement
- `src/translations/` - i18n files (en.json, es.json)

### Path Aliases & Import Rules

**Aliases:** `@/*`, `@/components/*`, `@/actions/*`, `@/types/*`, `@/schemas/*`, `@/utils/*`, `@/lib/*`, `@/skeletons/*`

**Critical Rules:**

- ‚úÖ Use path aliases (no relative imports) - enforced by tests
- ‚úÖ Types in `/src/types` only - enforced by tests
- ‚úÖ Schemas in `/src/schemas` only - enforced by tests
- ‚úÖ Skeletons from `@/skeletons/mailchimp` NOT `@/components/ui/skeleton`
- ‚úÖ Dates from `@/utils/format-date` NOT `@/utils/mailchimp/date`
- ‚úÖ Breadcrumbs from `@/utils/breadcrumbs` (use `bc` utility)

**See:** [Development Patterns](docs/development-patterns.md) for complete import patterns

### Testing & Quality

**Pre-commit hooks:** Auto-format, lint, type-check, test, a11y test, secret scan (Husky + lint-staged)

**Architectural tests enforce:**

- Path alias usage (no long relative paths)
- Types in `/src/types` only
- Server Components for layouts/not-found.tsx (404 status codes)
- No deprecated APIs (`z.string().datetime()`, `React.FC`, etc.)

**Run:** `pnpm test src/test/architectural-enforcement/`

### Required Reading Before Development

1. `docs/PRD.md` - Product requirements
2. `docs/project-management/development-roadmap.md` - Progress
3. `docs/project-management/task-tracking.md` - Priorities
4. `docs/api-coverage.md` - Mailchimp API implementation status
5. `docs/ai-workflow-learnings.md` - Learnings from recent implementations (table patterns, navigation, formatting)

### Pre-Implementation Checklist

**Before starting any new endpoint implementation**, verify:

- [ ] **Review error handling pattern** - Check `docs/error-handling-quick-reference.md` for current standard pattern
- [ ] **Confirm endpoint priority** - Verify in `docs/api-coverage.md` that this endpoint is next in priority
- [ ] **Search for similar endpoints** - Find comparable pages to match patterns (e.g., other list detail pages, other report drill-downs)
- [ ] **Verify parent page exists** - If nested endpoint (e.g., `/lists/[id]/segments`), confirm parent page (`/lists/[id]`) exists
- [ ] **‚ö†Ô∏è Plan navigation integration** - Determine ALL navigation entry points (WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN STEP 16):
  - [ ] **For nested pages:** Which parent page needs a link/button to this new page?
  - [ ] **For top-level pages:** Should this be linked from main dashboard (`/mailchimp`)?
  - [ ] **Navigation pattern:** Find similar existing navigation (e.g., "View All Tags" button in member-profile-content.tsx)
  - [ ] **Breadcrumbs:** Ensure bc.funcName helper exists in breadcrumb-builder.ts
  - [ ] Does this replace an existing page or add new functionality?

  **Example:** For Member Notes (`/lists/[id]/members/[subscriber_hash]/notes`):
  - Parent page: Member Profile (`/lists/[id]/members/[subscriber_hash]`)
  - Add "View All Notes" button in "Last Note" card header (following "View All Tags" pattern)

- [ ] **Review existing schemas** - Check `src/schemas/mailchimp/` for reusable common schemas before creating new ones

**Quick References:**

- Error handling: `docs/error-handling-quick-reference.md`
- Comprehensive error analysis: `docs/error-handling-analysis.md`
- Pattern examples: `src/app/mailchimp/lists/[id]/segments/page.tsx` (reference implementation)

## AI-First Development Workflow

**üìö Complete workflow:** [docs/workflows/README.md](docs/workflows/README.md)

### Quick Reference

**Phases:** 0 (Git Setup) ‚Üí 1 (Schemas) ‚Üí 2 (Implementation) ‚Üí 3 (PR) ‚Üí 4 (Post-Merge)

**Checkpoints:**

- Phase 0 ‚Üí 1: User says "yes" after issue created
- Phase 1 ‚Üí 2: User says "approved" (AI proceeds automatically through Phase 2 completion)
- Phase 2 ‚Üí 2.75: AI presents summary, user tests naturally (no explicit checkpoint)
- Phase 2.75 ‚Üí 3: User says "ready to push" or "smoke test passed"

### User Intent Classification

| User Says                 | Intent         | AI Response                                        |
| ------------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| "Can we learn from X?"    | Research       | Present findings + ASK before implementing         |
| "Improve X"               | Ambiguous      | ASK: "(A) Analyze (B) Create issue (C) Implement?" |
| "Implement X"             | Implementation | ‚úÖ Proceed to Phase 0                              |
| "approved" / "looks good" | Approval       | ‚úÖ Proceed automatically (no additional pause)     |

**Red Flags:**

- ‚ùå User didn't say "implement" explicitly
- ‚ùå No issue number yet
- ‚ùå Currently on main branch
- ‚ùå Request is vague

### Phase 0: Git Setup (MANDATORY)

**Before ANY code:**

1. Create GitHub issue: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`
2. Create branch: `git checkout -b feature/description-issue-123`
3. Initialize TodoWrite with issue number
4. ‚è∏Ô∏è Wait for user: "yes" / "proceed"

### Phase 1: Schema Creation

1. Fetch Mailchimp API docs
2. Create Zod schemas: `*-params.schema.ts`, `*-success.schema.ts`, `*-error.schema.ts`
3. Present schemas for review
4. ‚è∏Ô∏è Wait for user: "approved"
5. **When user says "approved":** Immediately proceed to Phase 2 (no additional pause)
   - DO NOT ask "Would you like me to proceed?"
   - DO NOT wait for additional confirmation
   - Respond: "‚úÖ Schemas approved. Proceeding to Phase 2 (implementation)..."
   - Start Phase 2 implementation immediately

### Phase 2: Implementation

1. Add PageConfig to `src/generation/page-configs.ts`
2. Run page generator
3. Implement: types, skeleton, page.tsx, components
4. Update DAL method
5. Run [Standard Validation Suite](#commands)
6. **Add navigation links** (MANDATORY)
7. Create local commit (DO NOT PUSH)
8. **Present implementation summary immediately** (don't ask for permission to continue)

**Phase 2 completion message format:**

```
‚úÖ Phase 2 Implementation Complete

**List [Endpoint Name] endpoint is now fully implemented:**

### Files Created (X):
- [list files]

### Files Modified (Y):
- [list files]

### Validation Results:
- ‚úÖ Type-check: Passes
- ‚úÖ Lint: Passes
- ‚úÖ Format: Passes
- ‚úÖ Tests: X/Y passing

### Commit Created:
- Commit hash: [hash]
- Branch: [branch-name]
- Status: Local only (NOT PUSHED)

The implementation is ready for testing. I'll wait for your feedback.
```

**Important:** Don't ask "Would you like to test now?" or "Please confirm smoke test" - just present what was done and naturally wait for user feedback.

### Phase 2.75: Testing Loop (User-Driven)

**User reviews ‚Üí AI fixes ‚Üí amend commit ‚Üí repeat**

```bash
git add -A && git commit --amend --no-edit
```

‚è∏Ô∏è When done, user says: "ready to push" or "smoke test passed"

### Phase 3: PR Creation

1. Push: `git push -u origin {branch}`
2. Create PR: `gh pr create ...`
3. Monitor CI/CD (auto-fix failures)
4. Auto-merge when checks pass

### Phase 4: Post-Merge

**Automatic (no user action):**

1. Checkout main, pull changes
2. Delete implementation branch
3. Close GitHub issue
4. Create `docs/post-merge-issue-{number}` branch
5. Update `docs/api-coverage.md` (commit to docs branch)
6. **CLAUDE.md documentation review** (check for redundancy, bloat, new patterns)
7. Add session review to `ai-workflow-learnings.md` (commit to docs branch)
8. Push docs branch & create PR
9. Auto-merge docs PR when CI passes
10. Present completion summary

---

**See [docs/workflows/](docs/workflows/) for detailed phase documentation.**

## Git Amend Workflow (Phase 2.75 Reference)

During Phase 2.75 local iteration, use `git commit --amend --no-edit` to keep one clean commit:

```bash
# Make changes, then:
git add -A && git commit --amend --no-edit
```

**Why:** Single atomic commit instead of messy "fix: X", "fix: Y" history.

**Safe when:** Commit is local-only (not pushed). **Never** amend after pushing without force-push.

### Phase 3: Push & Create PR (ONLY after explicit approval)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: AI must NOT proceed to Phase 3 without user explicitly saying:**

- "ready to push"
- "create PR"
- "push to origin"
- "ready for PR"

**DO NOT accept vague approval like "looks good" - user must explicitly request PR creation.**

**After explicit approval, AI automatically:**

1. Pushes branch to origin: `git push -u origin {branch-name}`
2. Creates PR using GitHub CLI:

   ```bash
   gh pr create --title "feat: implement {Endpoint Name}" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
   ## Summary

   )"
   ```

3. Presents PR URL: "‚úÖ PR created: {URL}"

### Phase 3.5: CI/CD Monitoring & Failure Recovery (Automatic)

**After PR creation, AI automatically monitors CI/CD until all checks pass, handles failures, and proceeds to auto-merge.**

See [docs/workflows/phase-3-cicd.md](docs/workflows/phase-3-cicd.md) for complete monitoring and failure recovery procedures.

**Critical Rules:**

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **MUST monitor in FOREGROUND mode** (NOT background): `gh pr checks {pr_number} --watch`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **MUST fix ALL failures** before proceeding to merge
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Auto-merge ONLY when ALL checks pass:** `gh pr merge {pr_number} --squash --delete-branch`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMMEDIATELY proceed to Phase 4** after merge (no user confirmation needed)

### Phase 4: Post-Merge Cleanup & Documentation (Automatic)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: This phase is FULLY AUTOMATIC. Do NOT stop or ask for confirmation.**

**Trigger**: Immediately after PR is auto-merged in Phase 3.5 Step 4

**AI automatically executes these steps in order without stopping:**

#### Step 1: Branch Cleanup & Sync

```bash
# Checkout main and pull merged changes
git checkout main && git pull origin main

# Delete local branch (remote already deleted by auto-merge)
BRANCH_EXISTS=$(git branch --list {branch-name})
if [ -n "$BRANCH_EXISTS" ]; then
  git branch -d {branch-name}
  echo "‚úÖ Deleted local branch: {branch-name}"
else
  echo "‚úÖ Local branch already deleted: {branch-name}"
fi

echo "‚úÖ Remote branch already deleted by auto-merge"
```

#### Step 2: Close Related GitHub Issues

**AI MUST close the issue that triggered this implementation:**

```bash
# Close the issue that was implemented
gh issue close {issue_number} --comment "Implemented in PR #{pr_number} and merged to main."
```

**If there were related issues mentioned in commits, close those too:**

```bash
# Example: If implementation also fixed a bug
gh issue close {related_issue} --comment "Fixed as part of {Endpoint Name} implementation (PR #{pr_number})."
```

#### Step 3: Create Branch for Post-Merge Documentation

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL:** All changes go through PR workflow, including post-merge documentation.

**Create documentation branch:**

```bash
# Create branch for post-merge documentation updates
git checkout -b docs/post-merge-issue-{issue_number}
```

**Why a new branch?** Maintains consistent workflow - all changes go through PR, no exceptions.

#### Step 4: Update API Coverage Documentation

**For Mailchimp endpoint implementations:**

1. Update `docs/api-coverage.md` in **TWO places**:

   **A. Mark endpoint as ‚úÖ Implemented (in endpoint list section):**
   - Add implementation details:
     - Route: `/mailchimp/{path}`
     - Features: List key features
     - Issue/PR numbers
   - Update coverage stats (X/Y endpoints, Z%)

   **Example update:**

   ```markdown
   - ‚úÖ **List Locations** - `GET /lists/{list_id}/locations`
     - Route: `/mailchimp/lists/[id]/locations`
     - Features: Geographic member distribution, Country-based subscriber analytics
     - **Priority 3:** Analytics insight
     - **Implemented:** Issue #278, PR #279
   ```

   **B. Update recommendation section (at bottom of file):**
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL:** If the implemented endpoint is listed in the "üí° Recommendation" section, remove it or update the recommendations
   - Find alternative next priority endpoints
   - Update "Top Choice" and "Second Choice" to reflect remaining work

   **Why this matters:** Issue #358 - Member Activity and List Locations were completed but still appeared in recommendations, causing confusion and duplicate work attempts.

2. Commit to documentation branch:
   ```bash
   git add docs/api-coverage.md
   git commit -m "docs: mark {Endpoint Name} as implemented
   ```

Issue #${issue_number}, PR #${pr_number}

Updated API coverage:

- Marked {Endpoint Name} as ‚úÖ implemented
- Added route and features documentation
- Updated progress: X/Y endpoints (Z%)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"

````

3. **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Validate the update was successful**
   ```bash
   # Verify docs/api-coverage.md contains the ‚úÖ marker for this endpoint
   git diff HEAD~1 docs/api-coverage.md | grep "‚úÖ.*{Endpoint Name}" || {
     echo ""
     echo "‚ùå CRITICAL ERROR: docs/api-coverage.md was not updated correctly!"
     echo ""
     echo "Expected to find: ‚úÖ **{Endpoint Name}**"
     echo "But the marker was not added to docs/api-coverage.md"
     echo ""
     echo "Phase 4 Step 4 FAILED - Cannot proceed until fixed."
     echo ""
     exit 1
   }
   echo "‚úÖ Verified: docs/api-coverage.md correctly marked as implemented"
   ```

**Why this validation matters:** Issue #338 - In PR #327 (List Interests), Phase 4 ran but Step 4 was silently skipped, leaving docs/api-coverage.md with stale üìã markers. This led to duplicate work in Issue #336. This validation catches such failures immediately.

**Note:** No push yet - will be included in final step.

#### Step 5: CLAUDE.md Documentation Review (MANDATORY)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: AI MUST perform this check after EVERY implementation, not just when patterns change.**

**5.1: Check for New Patterns**

Did this implementation introduce:
- New component architecture?
- New error handling pattern?
- New validation approach?
- New navigation pattern?
- Any deviation from existing workflow?

**5.2: Check for Redundancy & Bloat**

**Token Awareness Check:**
- Does CLAUDE.md have duplicate sections?
- Is any section >500 lines? (Consider extracting to `docs/`)
- Are there verbose examples that could be condensed?
- Can any section reference external docs instead of repeating?

**Documentation Health Metrics:**
```bash
# Run this check
wc -l CLAUDE.md
grep -c "^## " CLAUDE.md  # Count major sections
grep -c "CRITICAL" CLAUDE.md  # Should be <20
````

**Red Flags:**

- ‚ùå CLAUDE.md >3,000 lines (extract to sub-docs)
- ‚ùå Same content in 2+ places (consolidate)
- ‚ùå >20 "CRITICAL" warnings (dilutes importance)
- ‚ùå Verbose workflow steps (create condensed version)

**5.3: Take Action**

**If new patterns found:**

```bash
# Add to appropriate section (NOT as new top-level section)
git add CLAUDE.md
git commit -m "docs: document {pattern} from Issue #${issue_number}"
# Note: Committed to docs branch, will be pushed in final step
```

**If redundancy/bloat detected:**

```bash
# Create issue for future cleanup
gh issue create --title "docs: CLAUDE.md cleanup needed" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Problem
CLAUDE.md has grown to {lines} lines with detected redundancy.

## Redundancy Found
- {duplicate section 1}
- {verbose section 2}

## Proposed Solution
- Extract {section} to docs/{file}.md
- Consolidate {duplicate content}
- Create condensed reference in CLAUDE.md

## Benefits
- Reduce token usage
- Improve readability
- Easier maintenance
EOF
)"
```

**5.4: Documentation Principles (Apply Always)**

‚úÖ **DO:**

- Extract workflows >200 lines to `docs/workflows/`
- Extract patterns >300 lines to `docs/development-patterns.md`
- Create condensed summaries with links to detailed docs
- Use markdown anchors for cross-referencing
- Define things ONCE, reference everywhere

‚ùå **DON'T:**

- Duplicate content across sections
- Create verbose examples inline (extract to docs/)
- Add new top-level sections (group under existing)
- Repeat validation commands (reference Standard Validation Suite)
- Embed complete workflows (summarize + link)

**Example: Good Documentation Structure**

```markdown
## Feature X

**Quick Reference:** See [docs/feature-x-guide.md](docs/feature-x-guide.md)

### Essential Info (keep in CLAUDE.md)

- Critical rules (2-3 bullet points)
- Common command: `command --flags`
- Link to detailed guide

### Detailed Guide (extract to docs/)

- Step-by-step instructions
- All edge cases
- Verbose examples
- Troubleshooting
```

**Token Cost Awareness:**

- Every 1,000 lines ‚âà 3,000 tokens
- CLAUDE.md should stay <2,500 lines (<7,500 tokens)
- Aim for: "Can AI read entire file in one context window"`

#### Step 6: Add Session Review to ai-workflow-learnings.md

**AI MUST document this implementation session:**

**Create comprehensive session review at the TOP of the "Session Reviews" section:**

````markdown
### Session: {Endpoint Name} Implementation (YYYY-MM-DD)

**Endpoint:** `{HTTP_METHOD} /path/to/endpoint`
**Route:** `/mailchimp/{route}`
**Issue:** #{issue_number} | **PR:** #{pr_number} | **Status:** ‚úÖ Merged

#### What Worked Exceptionally Well ‚úÖ

- {Benefit 2}

#### Issues Encountered & Solutions üîß

**1. {Problem Description}**

**Problem:** {What went wrong}

**Root Cause:** {Why it happened}

---

#### Step 6: Present Completion Summary (Automatic - DO NOT SKIP)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: After completing all Phase 4 steps, AI MUST automatically present a completion summary. DO NOT wait for user to ask.**

**AI must immediately output:**

```
‚úÖ Workflow Complete

**PR #{pr_number} Status:**
- ‚úÖ All CI/CD checks passed
- ‚úÖ Merged to main
- ‚úÖ Branches cleaned up (remote and local)

**Phase 4 Cleanup Complete:**
- ‚úÖ Issue #{issue_number} closed
- ‚úÖ API coverage updated: docs/api-coverage.md (if applicable)
- ‚úÖ Workflow documentation updated: CLAUDE.md (if applicable)
- ‚úÖ Session review added: docs/ai-workflow-learnings.md (if applicable)

**Changes Merged:**
{Brief 1-2 sentence summary of what was implemented/fixed}

**Implementation Summary:**
- Files created: {count}
- Files modified: {count}
- Tests: {count} passing
- Total time: ~{time}

The workflow is now complete. All changes have been merged to main and documented.
```

**Rules:**

1. **DO NOT STOP** after Phase 4 cleanup - immediately present this summary
2. **DO NOT WAIT** for user to ask "is it done?" or "did it work?"
3. **DO NOT ASK** "would you like a summary?" - just present it
4. This is the final step of the workflow - present it automatically

**Why this matters:** Silent completion makes the workflow appear stuck or incomplete. Users should not have to prompt AI to confirm the workflow finished successfully.

# Monitor CI/CD checks
gh pr checks --watch

# Auto-merge when checks pass
gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch
```

**After documentation PR merges:**

```bash
# Return to main and pull
git checkout main && git pull origin main
```

#### Step 8: Implementation Review & Improvement Identification

**AI MUST review the merged implementation and identify improvements:**

**Review Checklist:**

- [ ] Are there repeated code patterns that could be extracted?
- [ ] Could any components be more reusable?
- [ ] Is the error handling consistent with other pages?
- [ ] Are there accessibility improvements needed?
- [ ] Could the user experience be enhanced?
- [ ] Are there performance optimizations possible?
- [ ] Is the navigation intuitive?
- [ ] Are there missing features that would add value?

**Create improvement recommendations:**

```
‚úÖ Post-merge review complete

**Implementation Quality:** {Excellent/Good/Needs Improvement}

**Identified Improvements:**

1. **{Improvement Title}** (Priority: High/Medium/Low)
   - Current: {What it does now}
   - Improvement: {What could be better}
   - Benefit: {Why this matters}
   - Effort: {Small/Medium/Large}

2. **{Improvement Title}** (Priority: High/Medium/Low)
   - Current: {What it does now}
   - Improvement: {What could be better}
   - Benefit: {Why this matters}
   - Effort: {Small/Medium/Large}

**Recommendation:** {Create follow-up branch now / Address later / No changes needed}
```

**If improvements are identified, ask user:**

> "I've identified {count} potential improvements to the {Endpoint Name} implementation:
>
> {List improvements with priorities}
>
> Would you like me to:
>
> 1. Create a new branch and implement these improvements now
> 2. Create GitHub issues for future work
> 3. Skip improvements for now
>
> What would you prefer?"

#### Step 9: Create Improvement Branch (If Requested)

**If user says "implement improvements" or similar:**

1. **Create new issue for improvements:**

   ```bash
   gh issue create --title "refactor: improve {Endpoint Name} implementation" --body "..."
   ```

2. **Create feature branch:**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/improve-{endpoint}-issue-{new_number}
   ```

3. **Implement improvements:**
   - Follow same Phase 1-3 workflow
   - Keep changes focused and reviewable
   - Maintain backward compatibility

4. **Create PR when ready:**
   - Reference original implementation
   - Explain improvements made
   - Show before/after examples

#### Step 10: Final Summary

**AI presents complete summary:**

```
‚úÖ Phase 4 Complete - Post-Merge Tasks Finished

**Git Operations:**
- ‚úÖ Switched to main branch
- ‚úÖ Pulled latest changes
- ‚úÖ Deleted implementation branch: {branch-name}

**Documentation Updates:**
- ‚úÖ Closed Issue #{issue_number}
- ‚úÖ Created docs PR: #{docs_pr_number}
- ‚úÖ Updated docs/api-coverage.md (if applicable)
- ‚úÖ Updated CLAUDE.md with new patterns (if applicable)
- ‚úÖ Added session review to ai-workflow-learnings.md

**Implementation Review:**
- ‚úÖ Quality assessment: {rating}
- ‚úÖ Improvements identified: {count}
- ‚úÖ Follow-up: {action taken}

**Next Steps:**
- {Improvement branch created | Ready for next feature | Other}

üéâ {Endpoint Name} implementation cycle complete!
```

**Important Rules:**

- DO NOT wait for user to request cleanup or documentation
- DO NOT update `docs/api-coverage.md` during implementation (Phase 2)
- DO NOT skip session review - it's required for all implementations
- DO NOT skip improvement review - continuous improvement is mandatory
- ‚úÖ **ALL changes go through PR workflow** - including documentation
- Create `docs/post-merge-issue-{number}` branch for Phase 4 updates
- Always close related GitHub issues
- Always ask before creating improvement branch

### Enhancement Commits Pattern

**When user requests small improvements AFTER main feature is merged:**

Make separate focused commits (< 20 lines ideal):

```bash
# Example: User requests "make emails clickable for future detail page"
git add src/components/mailchimp/lists/list-members-content.tsx
git commit -m "feat: make member emails clickable links to detail pages

Prepares for future Member Info implementation by converting email
addresses in the members table to clickable links that navigate to
/lists/{list_id}/members/{subscriber_hash}.

Changes:
- Added Link component to list-members-content.tsx
- Email addresses now link to member detail pages
- Applied primary color and hover underline styling

Related to future endpoint: GET /lists/{list_id}/members/{subscriber_hash}

```

**Guidelines**:

- Separate commit when user explicitly requests enhancement
- Include "Related to" or "Prepares for" context
- Reference future work in commit message
- Keep focused and small
- Create new PR if needed

### What Gets Generated Automatically

The programmatic API generates complete, working infrastructure:

```
src/app/mailchimp/{resource}/[id]/{endpoint}/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx              # Main page with data fetching
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ loading.tsx           # Loading skeleton
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ not-found.tsx         # 404 page (for detail pages)

src/schemas/components/mailchimp/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {endpoint}-page-params.ts  # UI schema for route/search params

src/components/mailchimp/{resource}/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {endpoint}-content.tsx     # Placeholder component (AI implements)

src/dal/mailchimp.dal.ts        # New method added
src/utils/breadcrumbs/breadcrumb-builder.ts  # New function added
src/utils/mailchimp/metadata.ts              # New helper added
```

### Benefits of This Approach

‚úÖ **Quality Control** - User reviews API contract before building infrastructure
‚úÖ **Learning** - User sees and understands schema structure
‚úÖ **Easy Corrections** - Fix schemas before generating 500+ lines of code
‚úÖ **Clear Checkpoints** - Explicit approval makes workflow predictable
‚úÖ **Async-Friendly** - User can review schemas later, then approve
‚úÖ **Consistency** - All pages follow same patterns automatically
‚úÖ **Speed** - 2-3 hours ‚Üí 5-10 minutes per page

### Tracking Progress

Check `docs/api-coverage.md` to see:

- ‚úÖ Implemented endpoints
- ‚≠ê Priority endpoints (next to implement)
- üìã Planned endpoints
- Implementation progress (X/Y endpoints, Z%)

### Workflow Summary

**User Involvement Required:**

- ‚úÖ Approve Phase 1 schemas (after review)
- ‚úÖ Confirm PR has been merged

**Fully Automatic (No User Action Needed):**

- ‚úÖ Branch creation
- ‚úÖ Phase 1 commit (after approval)
- ‚úÖ Phase 2 implementation
- ‚úÖ Phase 2 commit (after validation)
- ‚úÖ PR creation and push
- ‚úÖ Post-merge cleanup (after confirmation)

### Example Session Flow

```
User: "Implement the Location Activity endpoint"

AI: [Automatically creates feature/location-activity-endpoint branch]
AI: "‚úÖ Created branch: feature/location-activity-endpoint"
AI: [Fetches Mailchimp API docs]
AI: [Creates schemas matching API exactly]
AI: [Presents schemas with source docs and response example]
AI: "I've created schemas based on Mailchimp API docs. Please review."

User: "Approved"

AI: [Automatically commits Phase 1]
AI: "‚úÖ Phase 1 committed (4240049)"
AI: [Runs page generator]
AI: [Implements components, types, skeleton]
AI: [Updates DAL with proper types]
AI: [Runs validation: type-check, lint, format, test]
AI: [Automatically commits Phase 2]
AI: "‚úÖ Phase 2 committed (fb17638)"
AI: [Automatically pushes branch]
AI: [Automatically creates PR]
AI: "‚úÖ PR created: https://github.com/.../pull/218"
AI: "‚è∏Ô∏è Please review and merge the PR. Say 'PR merged' when done."

User: "PR merged"

AI: [Automatically checks out main, pulls, deletes branch]
AI: "‚úÖ Cleanup complete. On main branch, ready for next feature!"
```

**Key Points:**

- User only interacts at 2 checkpoints (approve schemas, confirm merge)
- All git operations happen automatically
- Clean, atomic commits for each phase
- No need to manually request branches, commits, or PRs

### Programmatic API Reference

**High-Level API** (recommended):

```typescript
import { generatePage } from '@/scripts/generators/api';

const result = await generatePage({
  apiParamsPath: string,
  apiResponsePath: string,
  apiErrorPath?: string,
  routePath: string,
  pageTitle: string,
  pageDescription: string,
  apiEndpoint: string,
  configKey?: string,  // auto-derived if not provided
  overrides?: {
    httpMethod?: "GET" | "POST" | "PATCH" | "PUT" | "DELETE",
    pageType?: "list" | "detail" | "nested-detail",
    enablePagination?: boolean,
    breadcrumbLabel?: string,
    breadcrumbParent?: string,
    features?: string[]
  }
});
```

**Low-Level API** (full control):

```typescript
import { generatePageFromConfig } from "@/scripts/generators/api";
import type { PageConfig } from "@/generation/page-configs";

const config: PageConfig = {
  /* complete config */
};
const result = await generatePageFromConfig(config, "config-key");
```

## Large-Scale Refactoring Workflow

**When to use:** Refactoring affects 20+ files, multiple layers, risk of breaking functionality.

See [docs/workflows/refactoring.md](docs/workflows/refactoring.md) for complete workflow, automation scripts, and rollback procedures.

**Key Principles:**

- **Type safety > code deduplication** - Accept duplication when refactoring breaks type inference
- **Test incrementally** - Run validation after each phase, not just at the end
- **Document rollback strategy** - Tag phases with `git tag refactor-phase-N-start`
- **Add tests for failures** - If CI catches something local tests missed, add test to catch it earlier

**Required Reading:** Issues #222, #223 (October 2025 schema reorganization case study)

## Development Patterns

**üìö Complete Guide:** [docs/development-patterns.md](docs/development-patterns.md)

### Quick Reference

**Critical patterns to remember:**

- **Error Handling:** All pages must have `error.tsx` + `not-found.tsx`, NO `loading.tsx`. Use `handleApiError()` + `MailchimpConnectionGuard`
- **Tables:** Pagination OUTSIDE Card, Server Components by default
- **Navigation:** Use `CardFooter` with `Button asChild` + `ArrowRight` icon
- **Breadcrumbs:** `bc` utility from `@/utils/breadcrumbs`
- **Data Formatting:** `.toLocaleString()` for numbers, `formatDateTimeSafe()` for dates

### Common Import Patterns

```typescript
// Error handling
import { handleApiError } from "@/utils/errors";
import { MailchimpConnectionGuard } from "@/components/dashboard/mailchimp-connection-guard";
import { DashboardInlineError } from "@/components/dashboard/dashboard-inline-error";

// Date formatting
import { formatDateTimeSafe } from "@/utils/format-date";

// Breadcrumbs
import { bc } from "@/utils/breadcrumbs";

// Skeletons
import { MemberTagsSkeleton } from "@/skeletons/mailchimp";

// Page params
import { validatePageParams } from "@/utils/mailchimp/page-params";
```

### Schema Patterns

**üìö Complete Guide:** [docs/schema-patterns.md](docs/schema-patterns.md)

**Quick checklist:**

- ‚úÖ Check for reusable common schemas first
- ‚úÖ Export path/query schemas separately (no `.merge()`)
- ‚úÖ Add `.strict()` with comment
- ‚úÖ Use `.min(1)` for all ID fields
- ‚úÖ Extract enums to constants
- ‚ùå NEVER use `.default().optional()` (redundant)

## Schema Refactoring Learnings

See [docs/development-patterns.md#schema-refactoring](docs/development-patterns.md#schema-refactoring) for detailed analysis of what works and what doesn't.

**Key Takeaway:** **Type safety > code deduplication**

**When to accept duplication:**

- Eliminating it breaks type inference
- Pattern is simple (4-5 lines) and stable
- Alternative requires manual type assertions everywhere

**Related Issues:** #222, #223 (October 2025)

## Pre-commit Hooks Setup

**First-time setup:**

```bash
# Configure Git to use Husky hooks
git config core.hooksPath .husky

# Verify hooks are enabled
git config core.hooksPath
# Should output: .husky
```

**Hooks run automatically on every commit:**

1. **Quick validation** (`pnpm type-check`) - **NEW:** Catches type errors BEFORE formatting
2. Format staged files (`pnpm lint-staged`)
3. Verify formatting (`pnpm format:check`)
4. Type-check again (`pnpm type-check`)
5. Run tests (`pnpm test`)
6. Accessibility tests (`pnpm test:a11y`)
7. Secret scan (`pnpm check:no-secrets-logged`)

**Note:** The early type-check (step 1) prevents lint-staged from removing "unused" type imports that are actually used. This improvement was added in Issue #213.

**Troubleshooting:**

If CI/CD fails with formatting errors but local commits succeed:

```bash
# Verify hooks are configured
git config core.hooksPath

# If empty, reconfigure
git config core.hooksPath .husky

# Verify hooks exist
ls -la .husky/pre-commit

# Test hooks with dummy commit
git add . && git commit -m "test: verify hooks" --allow-empty
```

**See:** `.husky/pre-commit` for complete hook configuration

## Security

- Never log env vars, API keys, OAuth tokens, secrets (auto-scanned)
- Environment validation: `src/lib/config.ts`
- All API endpoints use Zod validation
- OAuth tokens encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM)
- HTTPS-only in production, CSRF protection via state params
