## Overview

This plan outlines the essential steps to integrate Kinde authentication into the dashboard, following project requirements and best practices.

---

---

## 1. Preparation & Project Setup

- [ ] Create a feature branch for the integration.
- [ ] Register a Kinde account/tenant and the Next.js app.
- [ ] Enable Google and email/password login in Kinde.
- [ ] Obtain and add Kinde credentials to `.env.local` and Vercel settings; document in `env.example`.
- [ ] Install the official Kinde SDK for Next.js.
- [ ] Enable debug mode during development (`KINDE_DEBUG_MODE=true`).

---

---

## 2. Schemas, Types, and Auth Service

- [ ] Create Zod schemas for Kinde authentication (user profile, error responses, etc.) in `src/schemas/auth/`.
- [ ] Define TypeScript types/interfaces for user/session, login state, and roles/permissions in `src/types/auth/` (export via `index.ts` using path aliases).
- [ ] Implement an authentication service in `src/services/` for login, logout, session management, and user info retrieval, using the above schemas/types and the Kinde SDK.

---

---

## 3. Authentication Flow & UI

- [ ] Implement `/login` and `/logout` routes/pages using embedded login (not Kinde-hosted).
- [ ] Support Google and email/password login.
- [ ] Show loading indicators during authentication checks.
- [ ] Display user info (name, email, avatar) in the UI (e.g., header/profile menu).
- [ ] Use `<LoginLink>`, `<LogoutLink>`, and `<RegisterLink>` components from the Kinde SDK.

---

## 4. Route Protection

- [ ] Protect `/mailchimp` and all subroutes using authentication middleware or a wrapper.
- [ ] Allow public access to the root page (`/`).
- [ ] Redirect unauthenticated users to `/login` for protected routes; optionally preserve intended destination for improved UX.
- [ ] Use the `withAuth` middleware and configure public paths as needed.

---

---

## 5. Auth Context, Error Handling, and Type Safety

- [ ] Implement a central auth context or hook (e.g., `useAuth`) to provide user info and future roles/permissions.
- [ ] Reserve a field for roles/permissions in the user/session model for extensibility.
- [ ] Show clear error messages and loading states using `isLoading` and `error` from the Kinde SDK.
- [ ] Use TypeScript for all types; import shared types as needed.

---

---

## 6. Testing, Validation & Documentation

- [ ] Test authentication flow locally and on Vercel.
- [ ] Validate route protection, redirects, and UI display of user info.
- [ ] Ensure robust environment variable handling.
- [ ] Use `/api/auth/health` for configuration checks.
- [ ] Update project documentation to cover authentication setup and usage.

---

---

## 7. Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- [ ] Add support for multiple user roles and role-based restrictions.
- [ ] Implement advanced error handling and session expiry management.
- [ ] Support additional social login providers (e.g., Microsoft).
- [ ] Add custom user profile fields and claims.
- [ ] Improve UI/UX for login and error states.
- [ ] Consider optional features (feature flags, organization support).

---

---

## 8. Documentation

- [ ] Update project documentation to cover authentication setup, environment variables, and usage.
- [ ] Add a section to the README or a dedicated doc for Kinde integration.
- [ ] Reference all relevant sections for best practices and workflow.

## Notes

- Follow the Git workflow: feature branch, frequent commits, reference issues, and open PR only after local validation.
- Pause for review after each major stage (setup, schemas/service, auth flow, route protection, error handling, testing).
- See "Kinde Next.js SDK Features for MVP" in this doc for implementation details and best practices.
