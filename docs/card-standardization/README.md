# Card Component Standardization - Phase Documents

This directory contains focused, phase-specific execution documents for the Card Component Standardization project.

## Why Split Into Phases?

The original execution plan was 2,130 lines long, risking:

- Instructions being missed due to cognitive overload
- Token/context limits making it hard to reference
- Lost details buried in walls of text

By splitting into focused phase documents (180-550 lines each), we achieve:

- âœ… Load only what you need when you need it
- âœ… Clearer focus on current task
- âœ… Better cost optimization (clear context between phases)
- âœ… Easier to update individual phases
- âœ… Reusable templates for future projects

## Document Structure

### [Main Overview](../execution-plan-card-standardization.md)

**162 lines** - Start here! Overview, phase links, expected benefits

### Phase Documents (Sequential Execution)

1. **[Phase 0: Setup](./phase-0-setup.md)** - 182 lines
   - Git branch setup
   - Pre-implementation validation
   - Environment verification

2. **[Phase 1: StatCard](./phase-1-stat-card.md)** - 465 lines
   - Create StatCard component
   - Types, tests, implementation
   - Simple metric display pattern

3. **[Phase 2: StatsGridCard](./phase-2-stats-grid-card.md)** - 469 lines
   - Create StatsGridCard component
   - Multi-stat grid layout
   - Header actions and footer support

4. **[Phase 3: StatusCard](./phase-3-status-card.md)** - 545 lines
   - Create StatusCard component
   - Status badge with metrics
   - Progress indicators and actions

5. **[Phase 4: Migrations](./phase-4-migrations.md)** - 264 lines
   - Migrate EmailsSentCard to StatCard
   - Document migration patterns
   - Before/after analysis

6. **[Phase 5: Documentation](./phase-5-documentation.md)** - 265 lines

### Reference Document

**[Reference: Checklists & Strategies](./reference-checklists.md)** - 418 lines

- Manual review checklist
- PR template and push strategy
- Rollback procedures
- Common issues and solutions
- Post-merge tasks

## How to Use

### Step-by-Step Execution

```bash
# 1. Read main overview
open ../execution-plan-card-standardization.md

# 2. Execute phases sequentially
open ./phase-0-setup.md
# ... complete Phase 0 ...

open ./phase-1-stat-card.md
# ... complete Phase 1 ...

# Continue through all phases...
```

### Cost Optimization

Each phase document includes a "Cost Optimization Note" indicating when it's safe to clear conversation context:

- âœ… **After Phase 1, 2, or 3:** Safe to clear, phases are independent
- ðŸ“‹ **What to keep:** Main overview + next phase document only

### Quick Navigation

- **Current phase blocked?** Check troubleshooting section in that phase doc
- **Ready to push?** Review [reference-checklists.md](./reference-checklists.md)
- **Lost context?** Re-read current phase document (everything you need is there)
- **Need rollback?** See rollback strategy in reference doc

## File Size Comparison

**Original plan:** 2,130 lines in single file
**Split plan:** 2,770 lines across 8 focused files

**Average phase document:** ~370 lines (82% smaller than original)

## Benefits Demonstrated

This split execution plan demonstrates:

- Following execution-plan-template.md best practices
- Focused, actionable documents
- Better maintainability
- Improved developer experience
- Lower cognitive load
