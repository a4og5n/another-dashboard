## Testing Strategy: Hybrid Approach

This checklist is designed for a **two-phase testing approach**:

1. **Phase 7.3a: Critical Path Testing (Pre-Deployment)** - 30 minutes
   - Test locally before deploying
   - Verify core functionality works
   - Catch showstoppers early
   - See "Critical Path Tests" section below

2. **Phase 7.3b: Comprehensive Testing (Post-Deployment)** - 90 minutes
   - Test in production after deploying
   - Validate real environment
   - Discover edge cases
   - See all test suites below

**Why Hybrid?**

- Balances speed with safety
- Minimizes production risk
- Gets realistic testing in production
- Allows iterative improvements

---

## Prerequisites
