# Execution Plan: Standardize Card Components

**Task Reference:** Card Component Standardization - Create reusable Card patterns
**Estimated Effort:** 4-5 hours
**Created:** 2025-10-18

---

## Overview

### Task Summary

Create three standardized Card components (`StatCard`, `StatsGridCard`, and `StatusCard`) to eliminate code duplication across 20+ Card instances throughout the project. These components will standardize common Card patterns and reduce boilerplate by ~400 lines of code.

**Success Criteria:**

- ✅ Three new standard Card components created with full TypeScript types
- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests with accessibility testing
- ✅ At least 3 existing components migrated to use new Card patterns
- ✅ Documentation updated with usage examples
- ✅ All tests pass (including architectural enforcement)
- ✅ Zero breaking changes to existing functionality

**Estimated Effort:** 4-5 hours

## Phase Breakdown

This execution plan is broken into focused phase documents for better manageability:

### [Phase 0: Git Setup and Pre-Implementation Validation](./card-standardization/phase-0-setup.md)

**Time:** 5-10 minutes
**Critical:** Must be completed first - ensures correct branch setup and checks for existing work

### [Phase 1: Create StatCard Component](./card-standardization/phase-1-stat-card.md)

**Time:** 45-60 minutes
**Deliverable:** StatCard for simple metric display (icon + value + label)

### [Phase 2: Create StatsGridCard Component](./card-standardization/phase-2-stats-grid-card.md)

**Time:** 45-60 minutes
**Deliverable:** StatsGridCard for multi-stat grid layouts

### [Phase 3: Create StatusCard Component](./card-standardization/phase-3-status-card.md)

**Time:** 45-60 minutes
**Deliverable:** StatusCard for status with badge and metrics

### [Phase 4: Migrate Example Components](./card-standardization/phase-4-migrations.md)

**Time:** 45 minutes
**Deliverable:** 3 existing components migrated to use new patterns

### [Phase 5: Documentation and Final Validation](./card-standardization/phase-5-documentation.md)

**Time:** 30 minutes
**Deliverable:** Updated documentation and full validation

### [Reference: Checklists and Strategies](./card-standardization/reference-checklists.md)

**Reference:** Manual review checklist, PR template, rollback strategy

## How to Use This Plan

### Sequential Execution (Recommended)

Execute phases in order, one at a time:

1. **Start with Phase 0** - Critical setup and validation
2. **Complete one phase before starting the next** - Each phase has validation checkpoints
3. **Commit after each phase** - Maintains working codebase at all times
4. **Clear context between phases** - Marked in each phase document for cost optimization

### Phase Document Structure

Each phase document includes:

- **Pre-Phase Checklist** - Validation before starting work
- **Files to Create/Modify** - Clear list of affected files
- **Implementation Steps** - Detailed instructions with code examples
- **Validation Steps** - How to verify the phase is complete
- **Commit Checkpoint** - Git commit command with message
- **Cost Optimization Note** - When it's safe to clear conversation context

### Cost Optimization Strategy

To manage token usage efficiently:

- **After Phase 1, 2, or 3:** Clear conversation, keep execution plan, proceed to next phase
- **Phase document** contains everything needed for that phase
- **No need to reload** previous phase instructions

## Files Affected Summary

### Files to Create (13 new files)

**Types (3 files):**

- `src/types/components/ui/stat-card.ts`
- `src/types/components/ui/stats-grid-card.ts`
- `src/types/components/ui/status-card.ts`

**Components (6 files):**

- `src/components/ui/stat-card.tsx` + `.test.tsx`
- `src/components/ui/stats-grid-card.tsx` + `.test.tsx`
- `src/components/ui/status-card.tsx` + `.test.tsx`

### Files to Modify (4 files)

- `src/types/components/ui/index.ts` - Export new types
- `src/components/dashboard/reports/EmailsSentCard.tsx` - Migrate to StatCard
- `src/components/dashboard/reports/OpensCard.tsx` - Notes for StatsGridCard migration
- `CLAUDE.md` - Add Card component patterns section

---

## Expected Benefits

1. **~400 lines of code eliminated** across existing components (when fully migrated)
2. **~50% faster** to create new card-based features
3. **Consistent styling** and behavior across all metric cards
4. **Built-in accessibility** (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant)
5. **Type-safe** with full TypeScript support
6. **Zero breaking changes** to existing functionality

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Open Phase 0 setup document
open docs/card-standardization/phase-0-setup.md

# 2. Follow instructions in Phase 0 to set up git branch

# 3. Proceed through phases sequentially
```

---

## Future Enhancements (Optional Follow-up)

After completing this plan, consider:

- Migrate remaining 15+ Card components to use standard patterns
- Create additional specialized Card variants if patterns emerge
- Add storybook stories for each Card component
- Create Card component generator script

**Estimated Additional Savings:** ~300 more lines of code reduction

## Need Help?

- **Lost context?** Re-read the current phase document you're working on
- **Stuck on a phase?** Check the validation steps and rollback strategy in [reference-checklists.md](./card-standardization/reference-checklists.md)
- **Want to skip ahead?** Don't - each phase builds on the previous one
- **Found an issue?** Stop, rollback the current phase, and reassess
