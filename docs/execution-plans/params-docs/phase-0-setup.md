# Phase 0: Git Setup and Pre-Implementation Validation

**Goal:** Ensure correct git branch setup and verify no work has already been completed

**Estimated Time:** 5-10 minutes

**⚠️ CRITICAL: This phase MUST be completed before any documentation work begins**

---

## Step 1: Verify Current Branch

```bash
# Check what branch you're currently on
git branch --show-current
```

**Expected outcomes:**

- ✅ **If on feature branch matching this plan:** Proceed to Step 2
- ❌ **If on `main` branch:** STOP and proceed to Step 1b
- ❌ **If on different feature branch:** Confirm with user before proceeding

### Step 1b: Create Feature Branch (if needed)

**ONLY run these commands if you're on `main` or wrong branch:**

```bash
# Ensure main is up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create and switch to feature branch
git checkout -b feature/params-docs

# Verify you're on the correct branch
git branch --show-current
# Should output: feature/params-docs (NOT main)
```

**🛑 DO NOT PROCEED if `git branch --show-current` still returns `main`**

---

## Step 2: Check for Existing Work

Before starting documentation, verify the work hasn't already been done:

```bash
# Check recent commit history
git log --oneline -15

# Look for commits related to params documentation
git log --oneline --all --grep="params"

# Check if README already exists
ls src/utils/params/README.md 2>/dev/null && echo "README exists" || echo "README does not exist"

# Check if CLAUDE.md has params section
grep -n "params" CLAUDE.md | head -10
```

**If work is already complete:**

- Inform user: "The params documentation appears to be already completed. Found: [list files/commits]"
- Ask: "Would you like me to verify the documentation or move to the next improvement?"
- DO NOT re-write already completed documentation

**If work is partially complete:**

- List what's done and what remains
- Ask user how to proceed

---

## Step 3: Review Pre-Implementation Checklist

Verify you understand the task:

- [ ] Read `execution-plan.md` for full context
- [ ] Understand difference between `validatePageParams()` and `processRouteParams()`
- [ ] Reviewed existing utilities:
  - `src/utils/mailchimp/page-params.ts` (pagination utility)
  - `src/utils/mailchimp/route-params.ts` (route validation utility)
- [ ] Understand this is documentation-only (no code changes)
- [ ] Know where documentation will be created (`src/utils/params/README.md`)

**Review Existing Utilities:**

```bash
# Read both utilities to understand them
cat src/utils/mailchimp/page-params.ts
cat src/utils/mailchimp/route-params.ts

# See where they're used
grep -r "validatePageParams" src/app --include="*.tsx"
grep -r "processRouteParams" src/app --include="*.tsx"
```

---

## Step 4: Confirm Environment

```bash
# Verify Node.js and pnpm versions
node --version  # Should be v24.7.0
pnpm --version  # Should be v10.15.0

# Ensure dependencies are installed
pnpm install
```

---

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] On correct feature branch: `git branch --show-current` shows `feature/params-docs`
- [ ] No existing params documentation found
- [ ] Reviewed both utilities and understand their differences
- [ ] Environment verified and dependencies installed

---

## Checkpoint: Confirm Setup

```bash
# Create initial commit to mark branch creation
git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: initialize feature branch for params documentation"
```

Verify commit:

```bash
git log --oneline -1
# Should show your empty commit
```

---

## 🛑 STOP HERE

**Phase 0 Complete!**

**Checklist before continuing:**

1. ✅ On `feature/params-docs` branch (NOT main)
2. ✅ No existing params documentation found
3. ✅ Reviewed both utilities
4. ✅ Empty commit created

**💰 Cost Optimization:** Safe to clear conversation now

- Phase 0 is complete and validated
- Next phase (create README) is independent
- Can start fresh with just the execution plan

**Next Steps:**

- Clear conversation if desired
- User: "Start Phase 1" or open `phase-1-checklist.md`

**DO NOT PROCEED** to Phase 1 without user confirmation.

**✅ Phase 0 Complete - Ready to begin Phase 1**
