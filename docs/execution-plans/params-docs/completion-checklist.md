## Run Validation Commands

```bash
# Type checking
pnpm type-check
# Should pass with no errors

# Linting
pnpm lint
# Should pass with no errors

# Formatting
pnpm format:check
# Should pass with no errors

# If formatting fails, fix it
pnpm format --write .
git add .
git commit -m "chore: apply code formatting"
```

**Validation Checklist:**

- [ ] Type checking passes
- [ ] Linting passes
- [ ] Formatting passes
- [ ] No console errors or warnings

---

## Review All Changes

```bash
# Review commit history
git log --oneline main..HEAD

# Should show 4-5 commits:
# 1. chore: initialize feature branch
# 2. docs(utils): add params utility decision guide README
# 3. docs(utils): add README references to params utilities JSDoc
# 4. docs: add URL params processing pattern to development guidelines
# 5. (optional) chore: apply code formatting

# Review all changes
git diff main

# Check which files changed
git diff --stat main
```

**Files Changed (Expected):**

- `src/utils/params/README.md` - NEW (200-300 lines)
- `src/utils/mailchimp/page-params.ts` - MODIFIED (JSDoc updates)
- `src/utils/mailchimp/route-params.ts` - MODIFIED (JSDoc updates)
- `CLAUDE.md` - MODIFIED (params pattern section)

**Review Checklist:**

- [ ] Only documentation files modified (no code changes)
- [ ] All commits have good messages
- [ ] No unintended files changed
- [ ] No debug code or TODOs left behind

---

## Manual Testing (Optional)

Since this is documentation only, no runtime testing needed. However, you can:

```bash
# Verify README renders properly
cat src/utils/params/README.md | head -50

# Verify links in CLAUDE.md
grep -A 5 "params/README.md" CLAUDE.md
```

- [ ] README is readable
- [ ] Links are correct

---

## Push to Origin

```bash
# Final validation one more time
pnpm type-check && pnpm lint && echo "âœ… All validation passed"

# Review branch status
git status

# Push to origin
git push -u origin feature/params-docs
```

Copy the URL provided by git for creating the pull request.

## Create Pull Request

**PR Title:**

```
docs: add unified params processing pattern documentation
```

**PR Description:**

```markdown
## Summary

Implements improvement #4 from page-pattern-improvements.md. Creates comprehensive documentation to clarify when to use `validatePageParams()` vs `processRouteParams()` utilities.

## Changes

- **Created** `src/utils/params/README.md` with decision guide and usage examples
- **Updated** JSDoc in `page-params.ts` with README references
- **Updated** JSDoc in `route-params.ts` with README references and file-level documentation
- **Updated** `CLAUDE.md` with params pattern section

## Documentation Improvements

**Problem Solved:**

- Developers were confused about which params utility to use
- No centralized documentation for params patterns
- Decision-making took too long

**Solution:**

- Clear decision tree (<30 seconds to choose correct utility)
- Real code examples from the codebase
- Comprehensive README with usage patterns
- Enhanced JSDoc with cross-references

## Testing

- [x] Type checking passes
- [x] Linting passes
- [x] Documentation is clear and accurate
- [x] Code examples tested against actual usage
- [x] No code behavior changes (documentation only)

## Checklist

- [x] Documentation follows project patterns
- [x] No code changes (documentation only)
- [x] All validation commands pass
- [x] Links are correct and working
- [x] Decision guide is unambiguous

## Post-PR Tasks

After PR is approved and merged:

```bash
# Switch back to main
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Delete local feature branch
git branch -d feature/params-docs

# Delete remote feature branch (optional - GitHub can do this automatically)
git push origin --delete feature/params-docs
```

**Update tracking documents:**
