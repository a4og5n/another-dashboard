# Phase 3: Update Dynamic Route Pages (5 pages)

**Goal:** Add/update headers for all pages with dynamic route segments ([id])

**Estimated Time:** 35-40 minutes

---

## Prerequisites

**Before starting this phase:**

- [ ] Phase 2 complete (verify: 4 pages have standard headers)
- [ ] On feature branch: `git branch --show-current` shows `feature/consistent-comment-headers`
- [ ] Phase 2 committed: `git log --oneline -2` should show Phase 2 commit

---

## Pre-Phase Check: Verify Phase Not Already Complete

```bash
# Check if these pages already have standardized headers
head -n 15 src/app/mailchimp/reports/[id]/page.tsx
head -n 15 src/app/mailchimp/reports/[id]/opens/page.tsx
head -n 15 src/app/mailchimp/reports/[id]/abuse-reports/page.tsx
head -n 15 src/app/mailchimp/lists/[id]/page.tsx
head -n 15 src/app/mailchimp/general-info/page.tsx

# Check recent commits for this work
git log --oneline --all --grep="dynamic.*page\|detail.*page"
```

**If pages already have standard headers:**

- Inform user: "These pages already have standardized headers"
- Ask: "Would you like me to verify consistency or move to Phase 4?"

## Validation

Run validation commands:

pnpm type-check

# Linting (should pass - comments don't affect linting)
pnpm lint

# Quick visual check of headers
head -n 10 src/app/mailchimp/reports/[id]/page.tsx
head -n 10 src/app/mailchimp/reports/[id]/opens/page.tsx
head -n 10 src/app/mailchimp/reports/[id]/abuse-reports/page.tsx
head -n 10 src/app/mailchimp/lists/[id]/page.tsx
head -n 10 src/app/mailchimp/general-info/page.tsx
```

**Checklist:**

- [ ] All 5 pages have headers
- [ ] Headers follow standard template format
- [ ] Dynamic routes shown correctly with `[id]`
- [ ] Nested routes shown correctly (e.g., `/reports/[id]/opens`)
- [ ] @requires values are accurate
- [ ] @features are relevant to each page
- [ ] `pnpm type-check` passes
- [ ] `pnpm lint` passes
- [ ] No functionality changes (header-only)

## ðŸ›‘ STOP HERE

**Phase 3 Complete!**

**What we accomplished:**

- âœ… Updated 5 pages with standardized headers
- âœ… All dynamic route pages now have headers
- âœ… Updated 2 existing headers to standard format
- âœ… Added 3 new headers
- âœ… All headers follow the template format

**Progress:** 9/13 pages complete (69%)

**Before continuing:**

1. âœ… Code committed
2. âœ… Validation commands pass
3. âœ… Manual review of headers complete

**ðŸ’° Cost Optimization:** Safe to clear conversation now

- Phase 3 is committed and validated
- Next phase (settings and auth pages) is independent
- Can start fresh with just the execution plan

**Next Steps:**

- Clear conversation if desired
- User: "Start Phase 4" or open [phase-4-checklist.md](phase-4-checklist.md)

**DO NOT PROCEED** to Phase 4 without user confirmation.
