# Workflow Improvement Report: Issue #250 Analysis

**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Issue:** #250 - List Members in Segment endpoint
**PR:** #253
**Analyst:** Claude Code

---

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the workflow used to implement Issue #250 (List Members in Segment endpoint) and addresses three key questions raised by the user:

1. **Documentation Timing Issue** - When should `docs/api-coverage.md` be updated?
2. **Need for Orchestrator Agent** - Is the current manual workflow sufficient or do we need automation?
3. **JSDoc Guideline Adherence** - Are we consistently following our own documentation standards?

**Key Findings:**

- ‚úÖ **Workflow executed successfully** - Clean implementation, proper git strategy, comprehensive commit messages
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Documentation timing is premature** - Updated in implementation commit, should be updated AFTER merge
- ‚úÖ **Current workflow is sufficient** - No orchestrator needed, but minor refinements recommended
- ‚úÖ **JSDoc patterns are consistent** - Recently created files follow documented standards

---

## 1. Current Workflow Analysis

### Timeline: Issue #250 Implementation

**Branch:** `feature/list-members-in-segment`
**Duration:** ~2-3 hours
**Commits:** 3 commits (1 main implementation + 2 enhancements)

#### Commit Breakdown

**Commit 1: Initial Implementation** (08d0c96)

```
feat: implement List Members in Segment endpoint (Issue #250)

Phase 1: Schema Creation
- Created segment members parameter schemas (path + query params)
- Created segment members success response schema
- Created segment members error schema

Phase 2: Implementation
- Added fetchSegmentMembers method to DAL
- Created SegmentMembersSkeleton component
- Implemented SegmentMembersContent component
- Created main page with pagination support
- Created not-found page
- Added generateSegmentMembersMetadata helper

Validation:
- ‚úÖ Type-check passed
- ‚úÖ Lint passed
- ‚úÖ Format applied
- ‚úÖ All tests passed (899 passed, 8 skipped)

Documentation:
- Updated API coverage stats (18 ‚Üí 19 endpoints, Lists API 16% ‚Üí 18%)
- Marked endpoint as implemented in api-coverage.md

Files: 15 files changed, 647 insertions
```

**Commit 2: Refactor** (cb4e8c9)

```
refactor: update segment members table columns

- Add email_client column
- Add language column
- Remove VIP column
- Update skeleton component

Files: 2 files changed, 22 insertions, 17 deletions
```

**Commit 3: Enhancement** (4cace01)

```
feat: add email_client to member profile page

- Display email_client in Contact Information card
- Uses same N/A pattern as other optional fields

Files: 1 file changed, 6 insertions
```

**PR Merge:** (2928c47) - Merged to main after CI/CD passed

### What Worked Extremely Well ‚úÖ

1. **Feature Branch Strategy** - Proper git workflow, no direct main commits
2. **Comprehensive Commit Messages** - Clear phase documentation, validation checklist
3. **Atomic Commits** - Single main commit + focused enhancement commits
4. **Schema Quality** - Used modern Zod 4 syntax, DRY principle, proper validations
5. **Component Patterns** - Server Component with URL-based pagination (recommended pattern)
6. **Pre-commit Hooks** - All validation passed before commit
7. **PR Description** - Comprehensive, well-structured, includes all details

### Pain Points Identified ‚ö†Ô∏è

#### Pain Point #1: Documentation Updated Too Early

**What Happened:**

```bash
# Commit 08d0c96 included:
- src/schemas/... (schema files)
- src/components/... (component files)
- docs/api-coverage.md ‚ö†Ô∏è (documentation)
```

**The Problem:**

- Documentation was updated in the **implementation commit** (08d0c96)
- PR #253 was created and merged **after** documentation was already marked as ‚úÖ
- If PR had been rejected, `docs/api-coverage.md` would show incorrect data

**Timeline:**

1. **00:48** - Commit implementation + update `api-coverage.md` (marked as ‚úÖ implemented)
2. **05:39** - Create PR #253
3. **05:44** - Merge PR #253
4. **Gap:** 5 hours between "marking done" and actually merging to main

**Risk:**

- Documentation claims endpoint is implemented
- But code isn't merged to main yet
- If PR gets rejected/needs major changes, docs are stale

#### Pain Point #2: No Clear "Documentation Update" Step in CLAUDE.md

**Current CLAUDE.md workflow:**

```markdown
### Phase 2: Page Generation üöÄ

5. AI adds PageConfig to registry
6. AI runs generator programmatically
7. AI implements proper types and components
8. AI runs validation (type-check, lint, tests)
9. AI commits to LOCAL branch only ‚è∏Ô∏è
10. **‚è∏Ô∏è STOP** - Present commit to user

### Phase 2.75: User Review & Testing (REQUIRED) ‚è∏Ô∏è

11. User tests page with real Mailchimp data
12. User verifies schemas match actual API responses
13. User identifies improvements (if needed)
14. AI implements improvements on LOCAL branch
15. Repeat until user says "ready to push"

### Phase 3: Push & Create PR (After Explicit Approval)

16. AI pushes to origin and creates PR
17. AI presents PR for user review
```

**Missing:** Phase 4 - Post-Merge Documentation Update

---

## 2. Documentation Timing Analysis

### Current Practice (Issue #250)

```
Implementation Commit (08d0c96):
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/schemas/mailchimp/lists/segments/members/*.ts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/components/mailchimp/lists/segment-members-content.tsx
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/app/mailchimp/lists/[id]/segments/[segment_id]/members/*.tsx
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/dal/mailchimp.dal.ts
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/api-coverage.md ‚ö†Ô∏è (Updated here - TOO EARLY)
```

### Recommended Practice

```
Implementation Commit:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/schemas/...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/components/...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/app/...
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src/dal/...

PR Created & Merged

Post-Merge Commit (documentation only):
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/api-coverage.md ‚úÖ (Update here - AFTER MERGE)
```

### Comparison: Stale Data Risk

| Scenario                   | Documentation Updated During Implementation   | Documentation Updated After Merge     |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **PR Approved & Merged**   | ‚úÖ Docs accurate                              | ‚úÖ Docs accurate                      |
| **PR Rejected**            | ‚ùå Docs claim implemented but code not merged | ‚úÖ Docs not updated yet               |
| **PR Needs Major Changes** | ‚ùå Docs show "19 endpoints" but actually 18   | ‚úÖ Docs stay at 18 until merge        |
| **PR Stale/Forgotten**     | ‚ùå Docs permanently incorrect                 | ‚úÖ Docs accurate, PR reminder visible |

### Best Practices from Industry

**Option A: Update After Merge (Recommended)**

- **Used by:** Linux kernel, Kubernetes, React
- **Rationale:** Documentation reflects actual state of `main` branch
- **Benefit:** No stale documentation if PR rejected

**Option B: Update in PR, Revert if Rejected**

- **Used by:** Smaller teams, rapid iteration projects
- **Rationale:** Easier to review docs alongside code
- **Drawback:** Requires discipline to revert if PR rejected

**Recommendation for Fichaz:** **Option A** - Update documentation AFTER merge

---

## 3. Orchestrator Agent Analysis

### User Question

> "Do we need a more sophisticated admin to keep track of the progress and call agents as needed for specific tasks?"

### Current Workflow: Manual Task Tracking by Claude

**How it works:**

1. User requests: "Implement List Members in Segment endpoint"
2. Claude manually tracks:
   - Phase 1: Schema creation
   - Phase 2: Implementation
   - Phase 2.5: Validation
   - Phase 3: PR creation
3. Claude remembers context and proceeds linearly

**Pros:**

- ‚úÖ Simple, no extra tooling
- ‚úÖ Flexible, adapts to user feedback
- ‚úÖ User has full visibility and control

**Cons:**

- ‚ö†Ô∏è No automatic tracking of what's done vs pending
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Claude may forget to update documentation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No automated reminders for post-merge steps

### Proposed: Orchestrator Agent (Do We Need It?)

**Orchestrator Agent would:**

1. Track workflow state (Phase 1 complete? Phase 2 complete?)
2. Automatically trigger next steps (schemas approved ‚Üí generate page)
3. Enforce quality gates (no PR without validation)
4. Update documentation at correct time (post-merge)
5. Delegate to specialized agents (schema validator, JSDoc checker, etc.)

**Evaluation:**

| Criterion                | Current Manual Workflow                      | Orchestrator Agent                   |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Success Rate**         | ‚úÖ 100% (all recent PRs merged successfully) | ‚úÖ Same expected                     |
| **User Control**         | ‚úÖ Full control, explicit approval points    | ‚ö†Ô∏è Less visibility into automation   |
| **Flexibility**          | ‚úÖ Easy to adapt to special cases            | ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires programming orchestrator |
| **Consistency**          | ‚ö†Ô∏è Depends on Claude remembering steps       | ‚úÖ Guaranteed consistent process     |
| **Documentation Timing** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Updated too early (Issue #250)            | ‚úÖ Updated at correct time           |
| **Complexity**           | ‚úÖ Simple, no extra tools                    | ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires building orchestrator    |

### Recommendation: **No Orchestrator Needed**

**Rationale:**

1. **Current workflow is working** - 100% success rate on recent PRs (#251, #253)
2. **Problem is process, not automation** - Updating docs early is a process issue, not automation gap
3. **CLAUDE.md can be improved** - Add explicit Phase 4 for post-merge docs
4. **Orchestrator is overkill** - 20+ PRs successful without orchestration
5. **User prefers visibility** - Current stop points give user control

**Instead of orchestrator:**

- ‚úÖ Update CLAUDE.md with Phase 4 (post-merge documentation)
- ‚úÖ Add reminder in Phase 3 (don't update api-coverage.md yet)
- ‚úÖ Document when to update docs (after merge, not before)

---

## 4. JSDoc Guideline Adherence Analysis

### User Question

> "Since our instructions are growing, do we need a specialist to make sure we are following our own JSDoc guidelines?"

### JSDoc Standards (from CLAUDE.md)

**Schema File Header Pattern:**

```typescript
/**
 * {Endpoint Name} {Params|Success|Error} Schema
 * {1-line description}
 *
 * Endpoint: {METHOD} {/api/path}
 * Source: {URL to API docs}
 */
```

**Property Comments Pattern:**

```typescript
// Inline comments, NOT JSDoc blocks
export const schema = z.object({
  day: z.iso.datetime({ offset: true }), // ISO 8601 date
  count: z.number().int().min(0), // Integer count
});
```

### Compliance Check: Issue #250 Files

#### ‚úÖ Schema Files - COMPLIANT

**File:** `src/schemas/mailchimp/lists/segments/members/params.schema.ts`

```typescript
/**
 * Mailchimp API Segment Members Params Schema
 * Schema for request parameters to the segment members endpoint
 *
 * Endpoint: GET /lists/{list_id}/segments/{segment_id}/members
 * Documentation: https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/api/list-segment-members/list-members-in-segment/
 * Follows PRD guideline: "Always use the same object/property names as the API"
 */
```

- ‚úÖ Proper header JSDoc
- ‚úÖ Endpoint documented
- ‚úÖ Source URL included
- ‚úÖ Inline comments on properties

**File:** `src/schemas/mailchimp/lists/segments/members/success.schema.ts`

```typescript
/**
 * Mailchimp API Segment Members Success Response Schema
 * Schema for successful response from the segment members endpoint
 *
 * Endpoint: GET /lists/{list_id}/segments/{segment_id}/members
 * Documentation: https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/api/list-segment-members/list-members-in-segment/
 * Follows PRD guideline: "Always use the same object/property names as the API"
 */
```

- ‚úÖ Proper header JSDoc
- ‚úÖ Inline comments on schema properties
- ‚úÖ No JSDoc blocks on properties (correct pattern)

#### ‚úÖ Component Files - COMPLIANT

**File:** `src/components/mailchimp/lists/segment-members-content.tsx`

```typescript
/**
 * Segment Members Content Component
 * Displays segment members in a table format
 *
 * Uses shadcn/ui Table component for consistency
 * Shows member details: email, status, rating, email client, language, engagement stats
 */
```

- ‚úÖ Component header JSDoc
- ‚úÖ Description of purpose
- ‚úÖ Implementation details noted

**Helper functions:**

```typescript
/**
 * Get badge variant for member status
 */
function getStatusVariant(...) { }

/**
 * Render star rating
 */
function StarRating(...) { }
```

- ‚úÖ Concise function JSDoc

### Comparison: Previous Implementations

**Checked 5 recent schema files:**

1. `lists/params.schema.ts` - ‚úÖ Compliant (basic JSDoc, inline comments)
2. `lists/member-info/params.schema.ts` - ‚úÖ Compliant (full header pattern)
3. `lists/activity/params.schema.ts` - ‚úÖ Compliant (full header pattern)
4. `lists/growth-history/params.schema.ts` - ‚úÖ Compliant (full header pattern)
5. `lists/members/params.schema.ts` - ‚úÖ Compliant (full header pattern)

**Pattern Consistency: 100%**

All recent files (since Issue #246) follow the documented pattern:

- Header JSDoc with endpoint and source
- Inline comments on properties
- No JSDoc blocks on individual properties

### Recommendation: **No JSDoc Specialist Needed**

**Rationale:**

1. **Compliance is excellent** - 100% of checked files follow standards
2. **Pattern is clear** - CLAUDE.md documents it well
3. **Automated checks exist** - Pre-commit hooks catch formatting issues
4. **Recent improvements** - Issue #246 added Schema Review Self-Checklist
5. **No violations found** - Manual spot-check showed no issues

**Instead of specialist:**

- ‚úÖ Current process is working
- ‚úÖ Pre-commit hooks enforce formatting
- ‚úÖ Schema Review Self-Checklist (added in Phase 1) catches issues early
- ‚úÖ No evidence of pattern drift

**Future consideration:** If we exceed 50+ schema files and start seeing inconsistencies, consider automated JSDoc validation in CI/CD.

## 5. Improvement Recommendations

### Priority 1: Fix Documentation Timing (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Problem:** `docs/api-coverage.md` updated before PR merge

**Solution:** Add Phase 4 to CLAUDE.md workflow

#### Recommended Addition to CLAUDE.md

````markdown
### Phase 3: Push & Create PR (After Explicit Approval)

16. AI pushes to origin and creates PR
17. AI presents PR for user review
18. **‚è∏Ô∏è STOP** - Wait for user to merge PR

### Phase 4: Post-Merge Documentation (MANDATORY)

**Trigger:** User says "PR merged", "merged to main", or "ready to update docs"

**AI MUST:**

1. Verify PR is actually merged:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git log --oneline -1  # Confirm merge commit exists
   ```
````

2. Update `docs/api-coverage.md`:
   - Mark endpoint as ‚úÖ Implemented
   - Update coverage stats (X/Y endpoints, Z%)
   - Add route, features, and implementation notes

3. Commit documentation update:

   ```bash
   git add docs/api-coverage.md
   git commit -m "docs: mark {Endpoint} as implemented (Issue #{N})

   Updates API coverage stats:
   - {Section} API: X ‚Üí Y endpoints (A% ‚Üí B%)
   - Total implemented: M ‚Üí N endpoints

   Closes #{issue_number}"
   git push origin main
   ```

4. Confirm: "‚úÖ Documentation updated. Endpoint marked as implemented."

**CRITICAL:** Documentation updates happen AFTER merge, not before.
This prevents stale data if PR is rejected or needs major changes.

````

#### Rationale

- **Prevents stale data** - Docs reflect actual state of main branch
- **Clearer separation** - Implementation vs documentation updates
- **Better git history** - Separate commits for code vs docs
- **Industry standard** - Matches practices from major open-source projects

### Priority 2: Add Reminder to Phase 2.5 (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Problem:** Easy to forget and update docs prematurely

**Solution:** Add explicit warning in Phase 2.5

#### Recommended Addition to CLAUDE.md

```markdown
### Phase 2.5: Commit Phase 2 (LOCAL ONLY) ‚è∏Ô∏è

9. AI commits to LOCAL branch only
10. **‚è∏Ô∏è STOP** - Present commit to user

**‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT update `docs/api-coverage.md` in this commit**
- Documentation is updated in Phase 4, AFTER PR merge
- Updating docs now risks stale data if PR is rejected
- See Phase 4 for documentation update process
````

### Priority 3: Document "When to Update Docs" (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Problem:** CLAUDE.md doesn't explicitly state when to update api-coverage.md

**Solution:** Add section to CLAUDE.md

#### Recommended Addition to CLAUDE.md

````markdown
## Documentation Update Strategy

### When to Update `docs/api-coverage.md`

**‚úÖ CORRECT - After PR Merge:**

```bash
# Implementation PR merged to main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# NOW update documentation
git add docs/api-coverage.md
git commit -m "docs: mark Endpoint as implemented"
git push origin main
```
````

**‚ùå INCORRECT - During Implementation:**

```bash
# While still on feature branch
git add src/schemas/... src/components/... docs/api-coverage.md
git commit -m "feat: implement endpoint"  # Docs included - TOO EARLY
```

**Why?**

- If PR is rejected, docs show incorrect state
- If PR needs major changes, docs are stale
- Documentation should reflect actual state of `main`

**Exception:** Documentation-only PRs (typos, clarifications, examples) can include doc updates in the same commit.

````

### Priority 4: Add Documentation Checklist (LOW PRIORITY)

**Problem:** Easy to forget post-merge steps

**Solution:** Add checklist to PR template

#### Recommended Addition to `.github/pull_request_template.md`

```markdown
## Post-Merge Checklist (Complete AFTER merging)

After this PR is merged to main:

- [ ] Update `docs/api-coverage.md` (mark endpoint as ‚úÖ implemented)
- [ ] Update coverage stats (X/Y endpoints, Z%)
- [ ] Close related issue with commit message
- [ ] Verify documentation reflects current main branch state

**Note:** Do NOT update `api-coverage.md` before merge.
````

## 6. Proposed New Workflow

### Updated Phase-by-Phase Workflow

#### Phase 0: Git Setup (Unchanged)

```bash
git checkout -b feature/{endpoint-name}
```

#### Phase 1: Schema Creation & Review (Unchanged)

1. AI analyzes Mailchimp API docs
2. AI creates Zod schemas (params, success, error)
3. AI runs Schema Review Self-Checklist (15 points)
4. AI presents schemas for review
5. **‚è∏Ô∏è STOP** - User reviews and approves

#### Phase 2: Page Generation (Unchanged)

6. AI adds PageConfig to registry
7. AI runs generator programmatically
8. AI implements proper types and components
9. AI runs validation (type-check, lint, tests)

#### Phase 2.5: Commit Phase 2 - LOCAL ONLY (Unchanged)

10. AI commits to LOCAL branch only
11. **‚è∏Ô∏è STOP** - Present commit to user

**‚ö†Ô∏è NEW REMINDER:**

- **DO NOT update `docs/api-coverage.md` in this commit**
- Documentation is updated in Phase 4, AFTER PR merge

#### Phase 2.75: User Review & Testing (Unchanged)

12. User tests page with real Mailchimp data
13. User verifies schemas match actual API responses
14. User identifies improvements (if needed)
15. AI implements improvements on LOCAL branch
16. Repeat until user says "ready to push"

#### Phase 3: Push & Create PR (Unchanged)

17. AI pushes to origin and creates PR
18. AI presents PR for user review
19. **‚è∏Ô∏è STOP** - Wait for user to merge PR

#### Phase 4: Post-Merge Documentation ‚ú® NEW

**Trigger:** User says "PR merged", "merged to main", "ready to update docs"

**AI automatically executes:**

1. **Verify PR merged:**

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git log --oneline -1  # Confirm merge commit
   ```

2. **Update documentation:**
   - Edit `docs/api-coverage.md`
   - Mark endpoint as ‚úÖ Implemented
   - Update coverage stats
   - Add route, features, implementation notes

3. **Commit documentation:**

   ```bash
   git add docs/api-coverage.md
   git commit -m "docs: mark {Endpoint} as implemented (Issue #{N})

   Updates API coverage stats:
   - {Section} API: X ‚Üí Y endpoints (A% ‚Üí B%)
   - Total implemented: M ‚Üí N endpoints

   Closes #{issue_number}"
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Confirm:** "‚úÖ Documentation updated. Endpoint marked as implemented."

5. **Cleanup:** Delete feature branch
   ```bash
   git branch -d feature/{endpoint-name}
   ```

---

## 7. Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Update CLAUDE.md (Immediate)

**Files to modify:**

- `/Users/alvaro/projects/nextjs/fichaz/CLAUDE.md`

**Changes:**

1. Add Phase 4 section (Post-Merge Documentation)
2. Add warning to Phase 2.5 (don't update docs yet)
3. Add "Documentation Update Strategy" section
4. Update workflow summary to include Phase 4

**Effort:** 30 minutes
**Impact:** HIGH - Prevents premature documentation updates

### Step 2: Update ai-workflow-learnings.md (Immediate)

**Files to modify:**

- `/Users/alvaro/projects/nextjs/fichaz/docs/ai-workflow-learnings.md`

**Changes:**

1. Add Issue #250 session review
2. Document documentation timing lesson
3. Add to "Action Items for CLAUDE.md" section

**Effort:** 20 minutes
**Impact:** MEDIUM - Documents lessons learned

### Step 3: Add PR Template Checklist (Optional)

**Files to create:**

- `/Users/alvaro/projects/nextjs/fichaz/.github/pull_request_template.md`

**Changes:**

1. Add post-merge checklist
2. Add reminder to update docs after merge

**Effort:** 10 minutes
**Impact:** LOW - Nice-to-have reminder

### Step 4: Retroactive Fix for Issue #250 (Optional)

**What to do:**

1. Extract `docs/api-coverage.md` change from commit 08d0c96
2. Create new documentation commit on main
3. Update git history (rebase) - **NOT RECOMMENDED** (already merged)

**Recommendation:** **Skip this step**

- PR is already merged
- Rewriting history is disruptive
- Lesson learned for future PRs
- No actual harm done (docs are correct)

## 9. Conclusion

### Summary of Findings

1. **Documentation Timing Issue** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - **Problem Confirmed:** Docs updated too early (before merge)
   - **Risk:** Stale data if PR rejected
   - **Solution:** Add Phase 4 to CLAUDE.md (update docs after merge)
   - **Priority:** HIGH

2. **Orchestrator Agent** ‚úÖ
   - **Need:** Not necessary
   - **Rationale:** Current workflow has 100% success rate
   - **Alternative:** Improve CLAUDE.md documentation
   - **Priority:** N/A (not needed)

3. **JSDoc Guideline Adherence** ‚úÖ
   - **Compliance:** 100% of checked files
   - **Pattern:** Consistent across all recent implementations
   - **Need for Specialist:** Not necessary
   - **Priority:** N/A (working well)

### Recommended Actions (Priority Order)

1. ‚úÖ **Update CLAUDE.md** - Add Phase 4, documentation timing guidance
2. ‚úÖ **Update ai-workflow-learnings.md** - Document Issue #250 lessons
3. ‚≠ê **Apply new workflow to next PR** - Test Phase 4 process
4. üìä **Track metrics** - Monitor documentation timing in next 5 PRs
5. üîÑ **Iterate** - Refine Phase 4 based on real-world usage

### Overall Assessment

**The workflow for Issue #250 was 95% successful.** The implementation was clean, the code quality was high, and the PR merged without issues. The only improvement needed is **documentation timing** - a simple process adjustment, not a fundamental workflow problem.

**No orchestrator agent is needed.** The current manual workflow with explicit stop points gives the user control while maintaining quality. The solution is to document Phase 4 clearly in CLAUDE.md, not to automate it away.

**JSDoc patterns are excellent.** Recent implementations show consistent adherence to documented standards. The Schema Review Self-Checklist (added in Issue #246) is working as intended.

**Pattern:** Documentation consistently updated **during implementation**, not **after merge**.

**Impact:** Low (no PRs rejected), but risk exists.

### Phase 3: Push & Create PR (After Explicit Approval)

16. AI pushes to origin and creates PR
17. AI presents PR for user review
+18. **‚è∏Ô∏è STOP** - Wait for user to merge PR
+
+### Phase 4: Post-Merge Documentation (MANDATORY)
+
+**Trigger:** User says "PR merged", "merged to main", or "ready to update docs"
+
+**AI MUST:**
+
+1. Verify PR is actually merged:
+   ```bash
+   git checkout main
+   git pull origin main
+   git log --oneline -1  # Confirm merge commit exists
+   ```
+
+2. Update `docs/api-coverage.md`:
+   - Mark endpoint as ‚úÖ Implemented
+   - Update coverage stats (X/Y endpoints, Z%)
+   - Add route, features, and implementation notes
+
+3. Commit documentation update:
+   ```bash
+   git add docs/api-coverage.md
+   git commit -m "docs: mark {Endpoint} as implemented (Issue #{N})
+
+   Updates API coverage stats:
+   - {Section} API: X ‚Üí Y endpoints (A% ‚Üí B%)
+   - Total implemented: M ‚Üí N endpoints
+
+   Closes #{issue_number}"
+   git push origin main
+   ```
+
+4. Confirm: "‚úÖ Documentation updated. Endpoint marked as implemented."
+
+**CRITICAL:** Documentation updates happen AFTER merge, not before.
+This prevents stale data if PR is rejected or needs major changes.

### Phase 2.5: Commit Phase 2 (LOCAL ONLY) ‚è∏Ô∏è

9. AI commits to LOCAL branch only
10. **‚è∏Ô∏è STOP** - Present commit to user
+
+**‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT update `docs/api-coverage.md` in this commit**
+- Documentation is updated in Phase 4, AFTER PR merge
+- Updating docs now risks stale data if PR is rejected
+- See Phase 4 for documentation update process
