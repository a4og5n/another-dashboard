   - Richer than the 50-item activity endpoint
   - Better UX for member details

2. **Priority 3 Endpoint:**
   - Member engagement tracking
   - Important for analytics

3. **Medium Complexity:**
   - Activity timeline display
   - Action type badges
   - Date formatting
   - Estimated time: 2 hours

**Why Not First:**

- More complex than Member Notes
- Lower priority (3 vs 2)
- Member Notes is simpler quick win

---

### Option 3: Landing Pages (New Territory) ‚≠ê

**Endpoint:** `GET /landing-pages`

**Why Consider This:**

1. **Active Issue:**
   - Issue #249 created yesterday
   - Shows current user interest

2. **New API Section:**
   - Expands into Landing Pages API (0/9 ‚Üí 1/9)
   - Opens up new feature area

3. **Medium Complexity:**
   - List view with pagination
   - Landing page status badges
   - Publish status tracking
   - Estimated time: 2 hours

**Why Not First:**

- Higher complexity than Member Notes
- Breaks from member management flow
- Would be better after completing member features

---

### Option 4: Automations (New Territory) ‚≠ê

**Endpoint:** `GET /automations`

**Why Consider This:**

1. **Active Issue:**
   - Issue #248 created yesterday
   - User interested in automation management

2. **New API Section:**
   - Classic Automations API (0/14 ‚Üí 1/14)
   - Important marketing feature

3. **Medium-High Complexity:**
   - Automation workflow display
   - Status indicators (active/paused/archived)
   - Trigger conditions
   - Estimated time: 2-2.5 hours

**Why Not First:**

- Higher complexity
- New territory vs completing member features
- Better after finishing member management section

---

## üìã Detailed Recommendation: Member Notes

### Why Member Notes Is the Clear Winner

**1. Momentum & Flow:**

- Just completed Member Tags (similar endpoint)
- Same route structure: `/lists/[id]/members/[subscriber_hash]/notes`
- Can reuse patterns immediately while fresh

**2. Completes Member Management:**

```
‚úÖ Member Profile
‚úÖ Member Tags
‚è≥ Member Notes  ‚Üê Next logical step
üìã Member Activity Feed
üìã Member Goals
```

**3. Lowest Effort, High Value:**

- Estimated 1-1.5 hours (vs 2+ for others)
- Similar to just-completed endpoint
- High user value for support teams

**4. New Git Workflow Test:**

- First endpoint using new `git commit --amend` workflow
- Simple enough to test process improvements
- Low risk if workflow needs adjustment

### Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Schema Review (20 min)**

1. Fetch Mailchimp API docs for member notes
2. Create schemas (params, success, error)
3. Present for user approval

**Phase 2: Implementation (60 min)**

1. Create types and skeleton
2. Implement MemberNotesContent component
3. Create page with routing
4. Update DAL, breadcrumbs, metadata

**Phase 2.5: Local Commit (5 min)**

1. Commit locally (DO NOT PUSH)
2. Present to user for testing

**Phase 2.75: Testing & Iteration (Variable)**

1. User tests with real data
2. Fix issues with `git commit --amend --no-edit`
3. Repeat until approved

**Phase 3: Push & PR (5 min)**

1. User says "ready to push"
2. Push and create PR

**Total Estimated Time:** 1-1.5 hours

## üéØ Alternate Path: Complete Member Management

**If you want to complete the entire member section:**

1. ‚úÖ **Member Tags** (Done - Issue #247)
2. **‚≠ê Member Notes** (Next - Priority 2)
3. **Member Activity Feed** (Priority 3)
4. **Member Goals** (Priority 4)
5. **Member Events** (Priority 4)

**Benefits:**

- Complete member management feature set
- Consistent workflow across similar endpoints
- Clear section completion milestone

**Downside:**

- Delays exploration of other API sections
- May feel repetitive

---

## üöÄ Alternative: New Territory

**If you want variety instead of completion:**

**Best Options:**

1. **Landing Pages** (Issue #249) - Conversion tracking
2. **Automations** (Issue #248) - Marketing workflows
3. **Campaigns List** - Campaign management foundation

**Benefits:**

- Explore different API sections
- Learn new patterns
- Expand feature coverage

**Downside:**

- Higher complexity
- Breaks from established flow
- Longer implementation time

---

## üìä Implementation Statistics

**Last 5 Implementations:**

1. Member Tags - 4 commits (75% fix commits) - 2 hours
2. Segment Members - 1 commit (0% fix commits) - 1 hour
3. Search Members - 3 commits (67% fix commits) - 1.5 hours
4. List Segments - 2 commits (50% fix commits) - 1.5 hours
5. Member Profile - 3 commits (67% fix commits) - 2 hours

**Average:** 2.6 commits, 60% fix commits, 1.6 hours

**With New Git Amend Workflow:**
**Target:** 1 commit, 0% fix commits, 1-1.5 hours

## ‚úÖ Final Recommendation

**Implement Member Notes Next**

**Rationale:**

1. Natural continuation of Member Tags
2. Priority 2 (high value)
3. Lowest complexity (quick win)
4. Tests new git amend workflow
