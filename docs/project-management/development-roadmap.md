## 🔧 CURRENT FOCUS: Development Workflow Enhancement (August 25, 2025)

### 📊 Issue Analysis: CI/CD Process Improvement

**Problem Identified:**
During the pagination feature implementation (PR #3), multiple CI/CD iterations were required to resolve issues that could have been caught locally:

- ❌ **Late Issue Detection**: Formatting, accessibility tests, and type errors caught in CI/CD
- ❌ **Inefficient Workflow**: Multiple PR updates needed for issues preventable locally
- ❌ **Developer Experience**: Waiting for CI/CD feedback instead of immediate local validation

### 🚀 Solution: Enhanced Local Development Pipeline

#### **Phase 5: Local Development Automation** 🏗️

**Target Completion:** August 25, 2025 (Same Day)

##### 🎯 Core Improvements

1. **Pre-commit Hook Enhancement**

   ```bash
   # Current: Husky installed but not configured
   # Target: Comprehensive pre-commit validation
   ```

2. **Local Validation Scripts**
   - ✅ Available: `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm format:check`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm test:a11y`
   - 🔄 **NEEDED**: Automated execution before commits

3. **Developer Experience Scripts**
   - 🔄 **NEW**: `pnpm pre-commit` - Run all checks locally
   - 🔄 **NEW**: `pnpm validate` - Full validation pipeline
   - 🔄 **NEW**: `pnpm quick-check` - Essential checks only

##### 📋 Implementation Tasks

###### 🔧 **Task 5.1: Configure Pre-commit Hooks**

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

```bash
# Setup Husky pre-commit hooks
pnpm husky install
echo "pnpm pre-commit" > .husky/pre-commit
chmod +x .husky/pre-commit
```

**Validation Steps:**

- [✅] Type checking (`pnpm type-check`)
- [✅] Code linting (`pnpm lint`)
- [✅] Format validation (`pnpm format:check`)
- [✅] Unit tests (`pnpm test`)
- [✅] Accessibility tests (`pnpm test:a11y`)

###### 🔧 **Task 5.2: Enhanced Package Scripts**

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

```jsonc
// Added to package.json scripts
{
  "pre-commit": "pnpm type-check && pnpm lint && pnpm format:check && pnpm test && pnpm test:a11y",
  "validate": "pnpm pre-commit && pnpm build",
  "quick-check": "pnpm type-check && pnpm lint",
}
```

###### 🔧 **Task 5.3: Documentation Updates**

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
