This document provides best practices and guidance for developing with this Next.js project structure. Follow these patterns for consistent and maintainable code.

## Essential Project Documentation

Before starting any development work, always review the key project documentation to understand context, goals, and current status:

### Required Reading

1. **`docs/PRD.md`** - Product Requirements Document
   - Review the problem statement, solution overview, and key objectives
   - Understand target users, personas, and use cases
   - Check current MVP features and requirements
   - Align all development with the defined success criteria

2. **`docs/project-management/development-roadmap.md`** - Development Progress
   - Review completed phases and current status
   - Understand what features have been delivered
   - Check current focus areas and next priorities
   - Note any recent achievements or workflow improvements

3. **`docs/project-management/task-tracking.md`** - Current Status
   - Check the latest milestone achievements
   - Review current priorities and task status
   - Understand performance metrics and success indicators
   - Identify next phase opportunities

### Development Context

- **Project Status**: MVP Complete with ongoing enhancements
- **Current Phase**: Post-MVP feature development and workflow optimization
- **Key Achievement**: 70x acceleration - 10-week roadmap completed in 1 day

### Scripts and Node.js Module Type

- All scripts in `/scripts` must use ES module syntax (`import`/`export`).
- The project sets `"type": "module"` in `package.json` to eliminate Node.js warnings and ensure modern compatibility.
- Refactor any CommonJS scripts to ES modules if added in the future.
- **`require()` imports are forbidden in all TypeScript code. This is enforced via ESLint (`@typescript-eslint/no-require-imports: error`).**
- Linting is run in pre-commit and CI workflows, blocking commits and PRs if violations are found.
- Validate scripts locally after any changes to ensure zero runtime warnings.

### Before Making Changes

1. Read the relevant documentation sections
2. Understand how your changes align with project objectives
3. Check if similar features already exist
4. Review the current development workflow and quality standards

## üìÅ Project Structure Guidelines

### `/src/app` - App Router Pages and Layouts

- Use the App Router pattern for routing
- Keep page components lean, focus on layout and data fetching
- Place layout components in `app/_components` for route-specific UI
- Follow the route segment config patterns for metadata, loading states, and error handling
- Use Server Components by default, mark with 'use client' only when needed

### `/src/components` - Reusable UI Components

- Organize by feature or category in subfolders
- Create an index.ts file for each subfolder to export components
- Follow atomic design principles (atoms, molecules, organisms)
- Use shadcn/ui components as base building blocks
- Implement consistent prop interfaces with TypeScript
- Document component usage with JSDoc comments

### `/src/actions` - Server Actions and API Routes

- Keep server-side logic separate from UI components
- Use Zod schemas for input validation
- Implement proper error handling and type safety
- Follow RESTful patterns for API routes
- Document expected inputs and outputs

### `/src/types` - TypeScript Definitions

- Define shared interfaces and types
- Use descriptive naming conventions
- Export types from index.ts files
- Export types from index.ts files (including all nested subfolders)
- Avoid using 'any' type
- Implement strict type checking
- **Do not define shared types inline in components or actions.**
- **Enforce usage via lint rules, pre-commit scripts, and code review checklists.**
- **All index.ts files in `src/types`, `src/schemas`, and `src/utils` (including nested subfolders) must use path aliases for all exports. Relative paths (e.g., `./...`) are not allowed.**

### Error Response Schema Strategy

- **Always compare all fields of the error response to the shared error schema.**
- If the fields are an exact match, use the shared schema.
- If there are additional or different fields, extend the shared schema with `.extend({ ... })`.
- If the error response structure is fundamentally different, create a custom schema for that API.

### API Naming Consistency for Schemas

- **Always use the same object/property names as the API** when defining Zod schemas and TypeScript types. This ensures clarity, maintainability, and easier mapping between API responses and your codebase.

### Enum Pattern for Zod Schemas

- **Preferred pattern:** Define enum values as a constant array (e.g., `export const VISIBILITY = ["pub", "prv"] as const;`) and use that constant in `z.enum(VISIBILITY)`.
- This improves maintainability, enables reuse, and ensures type safety for both Zod and TypeScript.

### `/src/schemas` - Zod Validation Schemas

- Create reusable validation schemas
- Share schemas between client and server
- Define clear error messages
- Use strict type inference
- Keep schemas focused and composable
- **Do not define Zod schemas inline in components or actions.**
- **Enforce usage via lint rules, pre-commit scripts, and code review checklists.**

### `/src/utils` - Helper Functions

- Create pure, reusable utility functions
- Write comprehensive unit tests
- Document function purposes and parameters
- Use TypeScript generics where appropriate

### `/src/test` - Testing Utilities

- Use test-utils.tsx for custom render functions
- Follow testing patterns from example tests
- Use MSW for mocking API requests
- Write component tests using React Testing Library
- Ensure good test coverage for critical paths
- Keep functions small and focused

## üîß Development Best Practices

### Schema/Type Enforcement & Refactoring

- Add ESLint rules or custom lint checks to flag inline Zod schemas and type definitions in component files.
- Require imports from `schemas` and `types` folders for validation and shared types.
- Extend pre-commit hooks to scan for inline schema/type definitions and warn or fail if found.
- Use regex or AST-based scripts to detect Zod schema and interface declarations outside their designated folders.
- Make schema/type usage a checklist item in PR reviews.
- Add code comments in components reminding contributors to use centralized schemas/types.
- **Enforcement tests must recursively scan all index.ts files in `src/types`, `src/schemas`, and `src/utils` (including nested subfolders) to ensure all exports use path aliases.**

### Type Safety

- Enable strict TypeScript checks
- Use type inference where possible
- Define explicit return types for functions
- Avoid type assertions unless necessary
- Use generics for reusable components

### Error Handling

- Implement error boundaries at appropriate levels
- Use custom error classes for different scenarios
- Log errors with proper context
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Handle edge cases explicitly

### State Management

- Use React Server Components when possible
- Implement form validation with Zod
- Keep client-side state minimal
- Use URL state for shareable UI states
- Implement proper loading states

### Performance

- Use Next.js Image component for images
- Implement proper code splitting
- Use dynamic imports for large components
- Optimize API calls with proper caching
- Monitor and optimize bundle size
- **Track Core Web Vitals** using the provided Web Vitals utilities
- **Monitor performance metrics** with real-time analytics integration
- Use performance hooks to measure component render times
- Implement performance budgets and monitoring

### Testing

- Write unit tests for utilities and hooks
- Implement integration tests for complex features
- Use React Testing Library for component tests
- Mock external services appropriately
- Maintain good test coverage
- **Include accessibility tests** using axe-core and jest-axe
- Test keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes
- Validate semantic HTML structure in tests

### Accessibility (A11y)

- Use semantic HTML elements (header, nav, main, section, etc.)
- Implement proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3...)
- Add ARIA labels and descriptions where needed
- Ensure keyboard navigation works for all interactive elements
- Test color contrast ratios (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text)
- Use the provided A11yProvider in development for real-time checking
- Include accessibility tests using the axe-helper utilities
- Test with screen readers (VoiceOver, NVDA, JAWS)
- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines

### Performance Monitoring

- Track Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) using the WebVitalsReporter component
- Monitor performance metrics with multiple analytics providers (GA4, Vercel, custom)
- Use performance hooks (useWebVitals, usePageLoadPerformance) for component-level monitoring
- Implement performance budgets and set thresholds for key metrics
- Monitor bundle size and optimize for performance
- Use the Performance Observer API for custom metrics
- Track user experience across different devices and network conditions
- Set up alerts for performance regressions

### Local Development Validation

### Recommended Local Workflow

To ensure all code meets project standards and to avoid formatting or validation errors blocking commits:

1. **Run `pnpm pre-commit` before staging or committing changes.**
   - This command runs formatting, linting, type-checking, and tests in the correct order.
   - It will catch all issues early, including Prettier formatting errors.
   - Husky pre-commit hooks are set up to run these checks automatically before every commit. If any issues are found, the commit will be blocked until resolved.
   - No need to manually order validation steps‚ÄîHusky enforces this for you.

2. **Optionally, run `pnpm format:check` for a quick formatting check before staging changes.**

**Summary:**
Always run `pnpm pre-commit` before `git add` or `git commit` to catch all formatting, lint, type, and test errors. Husky hooks automate this process and block commits with formatting errors.

**Formatting enforcement:**

- Formatting is enforced locally via Husky pre-commit hooks and in CI via the `pnpm format:check` job.
- Contributors should run `pnpm pre-commit` and/or `pnpm format:check` before staging or committing changes.
- PRs and merges will be blocked if formatting is incorrect.

### Security

- Validate all inputs with Zod schemas
- Implement proper CSRF protection
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Follow security best practices for APIs
- Regularly update dependencies

### Code Style

- Use ESLint for code linting
- Format code with Prettier
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Document complex logic

## GitHub Workflow and Branch Management

When working with GitHub tasks and issues assigned to this repository, follow these workflow guidelines:

### Branch Strategy

Always create and use feature/fix branches when working on assigned tasks:

1. **Feature branches**: For new functionality or enhancements
   \`\`\`bash
   git checkout -b feature/description-of-feature
   \`\`\`

2. **Fix branches**: For bug fixes or hotfixes
   \`\`\`bash
   git checkout -b fix/description-of-fix
   \`\`\`

3. **Branch naming conventions**:
   - Use lowercase with hyphens
   - Be descriptive but concise
   - Examples: \`feature/add-user-auth\`, \`fix/navbar-mobile-layout\`

### GitHub Issue Workflow

When assigned a GitHub issue or task:

1. **Create a branch** from the default branch (main):
   \`\`\`bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feature/issue-description
   \`\`\`

2. **Make your changes** following the contributing guidelines

3. **Commit with meaningful messages**:
   \`\`\`bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add user authentication system
   - Implement login/logout functionality
   - Add JWT token handling
   - Create user session management
   - Closes #issue-number"
     \`\`\`

4. **Push the branch**:
   \`\`\`bash
   git push origin feature/issue-description
   \`\`\`

5. **Create a Pull Request** with:
   - Clear title describing the change
   - Reference to the issue number (e.g., "Closes #123")
   - Description of changes made
   - Any testing performed

### Pull Request Guidelines

- **Always use pull requests** - never push directly to main
- **Request reviews** from repository maintainers
- **Include tests** if applicable
